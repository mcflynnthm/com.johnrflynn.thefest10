					How does one gauge the success of a band pushing the envelope of a genre that receives little to no credit by the mainstream media? In the case of A Wilhelm Scream, the answer is âWho cares?â â As a band playing punk rock for over a decade, original members Trevor Reilly, Nuno Pereira and Nick Angelini havenât focused on success, image or whatever bandwagon a group can jump on to get their music into the ears of listeners: Itâs the ideal of music from an honest place, playing to the kids who want to hear more than a simple love song, or want an opinion rammed down their throats.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Within this ongoing endeavor, AWS has recruited the talents of Brian Robinson (bass) and Mike Supina (guitar); Two Great-Lakers who have strived to help develop the band into the most musically-diverse lineup theyâve had to date, touring all over the World in over 20 countries from Russia to Tasmania in support of their 2007 release âCareer Suicideâ (NitroRecords). &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After spending a few months at home developing a follow-up self-titled EP, AWS is back on the road to deliver punk rock that promises to cater to the kids who are fed up with âeverything elseâ. 				</description>

					ello boys and girls.  We are the Algernon Cadwallader from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  At our first Fest 3 years ago we littered the quaint city streets of Gainesville with all the puke we could muster convinced it prolong the weekend into eternity.  Once it was all over we looked forward to nothing else but our second Fest.  We spent most of last year hanging out with the Foodmax Food Store crowd looking unapproachable and stinky and putting out the vibe.  This year, our third Fest, will be the year we perfect the art.  The year we crowd surf to the best bands, terrify festers with our lack of motor skills, make important appearances and the hippest house shows, and lose our voice so much we are forced to carry around pen and paper to communicate.  Oh yea, we play music too.				</description>

    <description>
					Formed in late 2004 by brothers Andy and Ben Hendricks, Annabel has been a band devoted to constant progression.  With guitars that simultaneously bite and shimmer, kinetic drums, and Scotty Moses's silver-tongued bass lines, Annabel has created a sound both exuberant and lush; indie-pop with the energy of punk rock and atmosphere of shoegaze.  The key, however, is the songs themselves, filled with soaring melodies and massive sing-along moments.   &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In 2009, the Kent, OH troupe released their debut full-length, Each and Everyone, on Count Your Lucky Stars Records after a trio of self-released EP's.  With the recent addition of guitarist/keyboardist Corey Willis, the band is set to release their follow-up EP Here We Are Tomorrow later this summer.				</description>

    <description>
					Banner Pilot is a young punk rock quartet from Minneapolis that formed in 2005 and used to jokingly describe their band as, âif Jawbreaker, The Lawrence Arms, and Alkaline Trio got in a knife fight and Jawbreaker wonâ¦ but just barely.â Hell, thatâs actually a pretty good description! But that would make for a pretty bunk band bio and it doesnât quite sum it all up. Any time you have a band made up of hard-drinking bookworms, you just know thereâs a good story and some hijinx. First and foremost, they just unleashed Collapser unto the world. Itâs their first for the San Francisco punk label, Fat Wreck Chords. But before we get to that stuff, a brief history lesson and some insightsâ¦&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Thereâs a theory going around that attempts to explain why so many great bands come from Minneapolis. It suggests that the sub-zero Winter temperatures leave young Minnesotans with few options when it comes to activities and that the bitter cold compels them to hunker down and create art in basements and practice spaces. For those of you unfamiliar with the extreme weather weâre referring to, letâs just say that all the analogies involving witchâs teats and brass bras canât possibly do it justice. Itâs fuckinâ cold in the Twin Cities. And it sucks. But that never seemed to bother any of the locals, and Minneapolis is known as an overachiever when it comes to music scenes. Weâre not just talking about the Replacements and Prince; thereâs a lot of great indie bands, punk bands, and even an especially vibrant underground hip hop scene. Thus explains the urgency and drive behind Banner Pilot; and like their contemporaries, the intensity of their music rivals the harsh conditions. Whatever doesnât kills these bands, seemingly makes them stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Before the band caught Fat Mikeâs interest, they actually released a previous full length with NYCâs Go-Kart Records that put them on the map, so Banner Pilot didnât come out of nowhere. Half of the band emerged from the ashes of a Minneapolis outfit known as Rivethead, who were the train-hopping, dumpster-diving darlings of the basement scene. Bassist Nate also moonlights as a member of Off With Their Heads and has played on all their records. To put it simply, their punk cred is not in question. But that kind of stuff is not a concern of Banner Pilotâs and never has beenâtheyâre a band that does things for the right reasons and their sincere, punchy punk anthems are proof of that. Theyâre a truly Midwestern band in that respect: earnest, cerebrial, and passionate.				</description>

    <description>
					Banquets approach to punk rock is a breath of fresh air in a crowded scene. While admittedly the band was originally formed for fun by a group of friends, Banquetsâ debut 7âinch, âThis Is Our Concern, Dude.â, flashes some impressive songwriting. That should come as little surprise though given the bandâs pedigree. These guys have paid their dues in previous bands like Let Me Run, The Stand In, and The Banner. Those past experiences have obviously served them well as the bandâs rustic brand of anthemic and melodic punk rock should have fans of The Gaslight Anthem and The Loved Ones drooling for more.â¨âWill Miller(Beartrap PR)				</description>

    <description>
					"When particles decay in to other particles, these decays must obey the various conservation laws. As a result, pairs of particles can be generated that are required to be in certain quantum states. For ease of understanding, consider the situation where a pair of these particles are created, have a two state spin and one must be spin up and the other must be spin down. As described in the introduction, these two particles can now be called entangled since you cannot fully describe one particle without mentioning the other. This type of entangled pair where the particles always have opposite spin is known as the spin anti-correlated case. The case where the spins are always the same is known as spin correlated.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Now that entangled particles have been created, quantum mechanics also holds that an observable, for example spin, is indeterminate until a measurement is made of that observable. At that instant, all of the possible values, that the observable might have had, "collapse" to the value that is measured. Consider, for now, just one of these created particles. In the singlet state of two spin, it is equally likely that this particle will be observed to be spin-up or spin-down. Meaning if you were to measure the spin of many like particles, the measurement will result in an unpredictable series of measurements that will tend to a 50% probability of the spin being up or down. However, the results are quite different if you examine both of the entangled particles in this experiment. When each of the particles in the entangled pair is measured in the same way, the results of their spin measurement will be correlated. Measuring one member of the pair tells you what spin of the other member is without actually measuring its spin.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The controversy surrounding this topic comes in once you consider the ramifications of this result. Normally under the Copenhagen interpretation, the state a particle occupies is determined the moment the state is measured. However, in an entangled pair when the first particle is measured, the state of the other is known at the same time without measurement, regardless of the separation of the two particles. This knowledge of the second particle's state is at the heart of the debate. If the distance between particles is large enough, information or influence might be traveling faster than the speed of light which violates the principle of special relativity. One experiment that is in agreement with the effect of entanglement "traveling faster than light" was performed in 2008. the experiment found the "speed" of quantum entanglement has a minimum lower bound of 10,000 times the speed of light."				</description>

					Bedford Falls is not an emo band from Germany, an indie-rock band from the Pacific North West, a kiddie-metal band from Mitchigan or a pub-rock band from Edinburgh.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Bedford Falls is, however, some friends making music in their spare time.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They've been doing what they do since 2003. They wonder where the time went. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They play melancholy punk rock that has been compared to bands like; Husker Du, Buffalo Tom, The Moving Targets, The Lemonheads, REM, Teenage Fanclub, Superchunk and Leatherface amongst others. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They've toured the UK sporadically and released three split 7"Â singles. One on Newest Industry Records with Floridian band The Enablers, one with London band Sevens and Nines on Rat Patrol Records and one on Sheets of Tens Records with Failures' Union. They've also recorded an album, entitled "â??Savings And Loan"Â, that was released by Boss Tuneage Records on the 21st April 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 For most of the last seven years the line up of Bedford Falls has varied wildly, but has been based around the core line up of Tom Willecome (vocals/guitar), Jim Williams (drums), Peter Leakey (guitar/vocals) and James Reed. James left permanently in early 2010 to be replaced by Katie Gatt. We needed a woman's touch about the place.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Other musicians who've drifted in and out of Bedford Falls have included members of such bands as; Harbour, The Keep, The Doublecross, The Osterman Weekend, Throwing Knives and Wraith.				</description>

					Ewoks were curious individuals that stood about one meter tall; they were omnivorous and used spears, slings, and knives as weapons; they also used hang gliders, battle wagons, and bordoks as vehicles. Although extremely skilled in forest survival and the construction of primitive technology like gliders and catapults, the Ewoks had yet to progress past stone-level technology when discovered by the Empire. They were quick learners, however, when exposed to advanced technology with simple mechanical processes and concepts.				</description>

    <description>
					Steeped in myth and rural legend, the Great American Rock n' Roll band is an ideal that has shifted over the decades from a respectable aspiration to something of a bedside fable. Barreling forth from the musicians' Narnia of Nashville, Tennessee, Blacklist Royals are chasing that dream with an intent and fervor usually reserved for those half their age. However, wishful thinking can only get one so far, and thankfully their years spent spanning sea to shining sea have armed them to the teeth with the tools necessary for such a quest. From slogging the dogged trenches of the Warped Tour to weeks spent honing this record in the studio, they've paid their dues in spades and now stand ready to greet the dubious returns. With the stage set for a thrilling hunt of Hemingway-esque proportions, the future remains uncertain. Unflinching, they're raising canvas, heading straight for the rising sun with melodies tempered and guitars at hand. Will they return from their expedition triumphant, settle as primitive kings on foreign shores, or find themselves cast with hearts of darkness, lost to the abyss? Trained, practiced, and readied, their adventure has already begun. Where it ends - none can be certain. The schism where the dream meets reality is a precarious point that few have reached and far fewer have returned from to tell the tale. 				</description>

    <description>
					Bobby Joe Ebola and The Children MacNuggits was mightily formed in 1995 in a fast-food parking lot by guitarist Dan Abbott and singer Corbett Redford. The often funny and sometimes scary band built a dangerously loyal following of punks, misfits, elected representatives, perverts and intellectuals, before going on hiatus for the entire tenure of the Bush Administration.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Recently reforming after licking their deep wounds, the band has rebuilt its war machine and is once again shocking contemporaries with toe-tapping uncomfortable truths.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The MacNuggits have become legend in the musical underground of the Bay Area and beyond, with their infamously unpredictable mix of searing social satire, soaring harmonies, outlandish and shocking truths, and poop jokes. The songs draw upon a variety of pop culture, of global crises, of interpersonal labyrinths, of nightmares and daydreams, skewering them on a rusty spit for the world to see. With a nod to social satirists like Lenny Bruce and George Carlin, and musical influences ranging from They Might Be Giants to Cocksparrer, Bobby Joe Ebola is the vaudeville routine for your personal apocalypse.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Dan and Corbett write the songs. Dan plays guitar. Then very strange things start to happen. The apocalypse, just like revolution, is not an event but a process, and itÃ¢â¬â¢s hilarious.				</description>

					We've all read bullshit rock bios that are bloated with adjectives and preach about the "humble beginnings" of a band. We're all sick of them. Do we really need one more?&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Yes we do! From humble beginnings, Bomb the Music Industry! has used their raucous and frenetic upstroking to undermine the conscious efforts of backward thinking economists and teen heartthrob musicians. Can you believe that this band originally started as a bedroom recording project of musician Jeff Rosenstock?&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"It was crazy, man," Rosenstock remembers, "I remember I wanted to write more songs, and in order to do that I had to release the songs I had. The quickest way to do that was to do it for free." Rosenstock turned free music into a real enterprise when he vigilantly started Quote Unquote Records, a revolutionary donation-based label that now boasts almost forty releases. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Trombonist Matt Keegan looks back, "It got really intense. First they're putting out music for free and all of a sudden Mike Park and Asian Man Records are flying them out for lunches and they're holed up in a studio lockout recording music with the best equipment money can buy. I mean, I wasn't in the band then, but I can only imagine."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
This energetic tantalizing six-piece professional powerful punk rock band from Brooklyn, NY (home of Vampire Weekend, The Strokes, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, LCD Soundsystem) has had their share of ups as well as downs. "We told Less Than Jake, The Slackers, Mustard Plug... all those fucking bands, we didn't give a fucking shit," claims Laura Stevenson, "If they didn't get the beer than we asked for backstage, we're not going on. It's an important part of our show. They knew not to fucking mess with us, and those shows ended up being great."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Adds a smiling Stevenson, "And the pussy..." [slides hands together, stretches hands apart, slaps hands on the ground]&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The biggest bands in the world have given Bomb the Music Industry! credit with making alternative music exciting yet again. Beck, Radiohead and Bob Dylan are all quoted as being major Bombheads (street term for Bomb the Music Industry! fans.) Where can they go next? After the massive tours and Broadway musicals, Rosenstock predicts the band will go back to their roots. "We're always down for whatever, but whatever whatever is, why don't we just enjoy it? We feel so fucking fortunate that it's fucking us doing this and not some fucking assholes who have just been blowing their ways to the top."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"Besides, it's like what we can all agree on. Fuck the man, dude."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Fuck the man, indeed.				</description>

    <description>
					Burning Love started in 2007 as a side project to the bands Cursed and Our Father. The plan was to channel their varied favorites (from Black Flag to Hot Snakes) despite their large differences of age, generation and frame of reference - and make some loud and riff-driven punk songs that were creatively different than either of their previous bands, and to challenge themselves and their listeners by striking out in different musical and aesthetic directions than expected. BL has since taken to the front burner, released a bunch of records, killed several vans and played a ton of shows and shit. Let's have sex. 				</description>

    <description>
					Amongst a series of Atlanta scenes where so many bands have gone on scrambling to find their latest skin, the men of Campaign have been throwing down the sound in flesh for years. Where those other bands aim to romance and dance, Campaign pours a thicker cup of blood: this is music in the essence of the brotherhood of hardcore, the shift and light of shoegaze, the party of punk.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Formed from the meat of some of greater Atlanta's most beloved acts,"Campaign" comes to the front of the flood riding having ridden through the shit. With the same grit that made bands like Hot Water Music, Jawbreaker, and Dag Nasty not only powerful but seared to memory, and fun, Campaign summons an immediate and heaving presence, edging that classic sound to directions it has needed after all that light. Rough enough to make you spill your beer, warm enough to be stuck in your head while driving home slick with the sweat, Campaign is making their own way, and it erupts. Fusing melodic vocals with choppy breakdowns, guitars that construct ambient texture at the same time as they shred, at the heart here is an unmistakable candor, a cohesion, recollection armed with razor teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Laying witness to this throwdown, the band's second EP It Likes To Party wields five anthemic tracks  so confident and patent in their approach it's like you've heard them in your blood somewhere before and yet at the same time pumped through fresh veins. This blood is fresher, larger, wants you more. The one thing you can't fake in music is spirit, formed in spit and precision, and something bigger, something fought for, and in that way Campaign already has it all, and only more to come.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
- Blake Butler author of "Ever" and "Scorch Atlas"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Formed in 2005 from the ashes of some of Vancouver's biggest post-punk bands (All State&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Champion/By A Thread/Daggermouth), Carpenter's rock n roll assault sprung from singer Daniel&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Sioui's obsession with the 1982 John Cougar classic "American Fool".&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Like Mellencamp, Sioui took aim at writing material that was lasting, catchy and heartfelt.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Along with JJ Heath (drums), Ryan Howlett (guitar) and Dana Edwards (bass) the band strives&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
for a rootsy, classic rock feel whilst retaining the intensity and DIY ethics of their punk and&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
hardcore roots.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Lyrically, Carpenter has painted pictures of the Canadian rural landscape and hi-lighted the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
struggles of the independent farmer. The band is a vehement messenger against the corporate&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
based Agribusiness industry; they've promoted sustainable farming practices and encouraged&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
support of organizations such as Canadian Organic Growers and Farm Folk City Folk. For the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
new album, Sioui continued his exploration into a life of living off the land. Inspired by the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
stories of Christopher McCandless (Into The Wild) and Timothy Treadwell (Grizzly Man),&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Daniel retreated to his isolated Ontario farm and penned early renditions of the record from a&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
trailer off the grid, far from the distractions and cacophony of the city. The end result is a more&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
personal and introspective record, that's raw, driving and more diverse than the band's previous&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
releases.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Recorded this spring with engineer Stu McKillop at Rain City Recorders (Broadway Calls,&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Living with Lions, Go It Alone) "Sea To Sky" features 10 tracks that embrace the musical&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
roots of its members. Hints of 90s emo and post punk seep into Carpenter's established rock&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
n roll sound. An evolution that keeps its members inspired to forge ahead and work tirelessly&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
to spread the word of Carpenter. "Sea To Sky" will be released this fall on Paper + Plastick in&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
the US and Gold Stock Records in Canada. A fall North American tour to support the album&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
has been confirmed with label mates Cheap Girls and runs from Oct. 2nd to Nov 13th, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Much like the farmers they admire, Carpenter are self sufficient, motivated, and organized. A&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
far cry from the rock n roll lifestyle glorified by today's media, but it's these qualities that have&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
led to the band's success to date. Determination and hard work have created one of the most&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
devastating and intense live shows out there, each one a celebration of friends and song that&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
leaves people humming and yearning for more.				</description>

					Caves are a raw, melodic, pop punk three piece from Bristol (UK). Dead catchy songs with girl/boy vocals, no songs over three minutes. Previous "sounds like" comparisons include: Superchunk, The Cut-Ups, Lemuria, Fifth Hour Hero, Flamingo 50. Releases so far include a 7" EP released on Specialist Subject Records (Falmouth, UK), and a split 10" on Records Or It Didn't Happen (Manchester, UK) with Pure Graft, Calvinball and Big City Plan. A split 7" with Wormburner is on it's way.				</description>

    <description>
					To describe Charles the Osprey as an anomaly within its music scene does insufficient justice to the band's brilliant weirdness. The drum-and-guitar duo's methodical execution of brain-melting instrumental spazz-rock is likely without peer anywhere. In 2007, Derek Lancioni--a prolific drummer who has performed in bands such as Just For Kicks, Go Josephine and Winnie Cooper--teamed with studio-rat guitarist Rafael Ohli to form Charles the Osprey. The duo, Charles to friends, began as a theoretical exercise: If two immensely gifted musicians attempt to perpetually challenge each other on a technical level, can substantial art be created in the process? Lancioni and Ohli's songs employ nonfancy guitar and drum sounds, but cover impressive dynamic territory as they weave through thickets of changes in time and tempo, some fluid, some jarring, all compelling. The hypothetical question underlying their existence has been answered with a resounding yes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In 2008, Charles issued a six-track EP titled Belongings. Its songs have names such as "The Frontal Lobe A-Go-Go," "Pheromones!Pharomones!Pheramones," "Same Hero Half the Calories," and "Lions &amp; Bumperstickers." The titles are courtesy of unofficial third band member James Barbour, whose function is to give things whimsical names. ("Charles the Osprey" was his idea.) The band's debut full-length, titled Consider, recorded at the White Lodge studio in Wayland, Michigan, and released by Grand Rapids-based Friction Records in 2010, finds Ohli and Lancioni realizing an expansiveness only hinted at on Belongings. The tracks pull off the contradictory feat of being simultaneously more adventurous and more accessible--melodies avail themselves quicker and atmospheric and tonal flourishes are now as common as the ever-present spatial experimentation. And one of Charles the Osprey's earliest critics, it turns out, was on to something: It does help to play their music really, really loud.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					Like a coconut that has fallen from a banana tree, Chotto Ghetto is shocking yet delicious. Fresh off their second Royal Caribbean cruise, the band is sun-tanned, Ray-banned, and ready to groove. So grab a frothy piÃ±a colada and kick back to the smooth contemporary island rhythms of Chotto Ghetto. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					To begin, you've got Chris- known primarily for his melodic howl and furious guitar riffage in Hot Water Music but also with a hand in lesser-known exploits The Draft, Rumbleseat, The Blacktop Cadence, and Cro(w)s. He's been working on these songs for over five years, long before Hot Water called it quits or The Draft was even a twinkle in his eye. They weren't written for a specific purpose, there was no real plan to release a record, no plan to form a band. Chris writes songs because he's a musician. You can't really call it a job and it's much more than a hobby. Some people were just meant to write songs.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Originally laid down on an acoustic guitar, these tunes were brought to life in the studio with a fantastic cast of characters. Ben Lovett got his hands on them first, bringing the same experienced touch that brought Matt Skiba's HEAVENS to life along with a host of film scores. And while Chris and Ben were tracking now and then in California, pretty soon, back home in Florida, long-time friend Addison Burns (The Enablers, Quit) entered the fold. Chris and Addison had started tracking their own "guerilla style"Â recordings wherever and whenever possible. The songs took shape from there, with Crescendo Sound Studios production wizards Derron and Addison leaving their usual spots behind the mixing board and returning to the Live Room beside HWM drum maestro George Rebelo. Chris' songs sprung to life, with layers upon layers of instrumentation creating an atmospheric, ethereal record full of eclectic masterpieces.				</description>

					Cobra Skuuuuuuuuuulls!  Theyâre back like a bunch of filthy, similarly-dressed super heroes.  Okay, letâs cut to the chase: You heard the name before but you donât know the finer points of what the band is about, right?  Thatâs where I come in.  Devin, the singer, bass player is a six -foot-six, 118 lb. Argentinian freakshow of a man.  Heâs also a bit of a rabble rouser.  Heâs often mustachioed, not because of the sweet irony, but because thatâs how they do it down there.  Heâs joined by Luke on the drums, who resembles Masters of the Universeâs Beast Man, and Adam, who (and I'm not even joking) honed his chops as a wedding singer and live Karaoke comptroller before he made the decision to make all the brides-to-be from his hometown cry and hit the road ten months a year.  That means he can play âTotal Eclipse of the Heartâ and âCry Me a Riverâ on command.  Beat that, assholes!  Wait, thereâs more!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
    The Cobra Skulls are from Reno, so lest you think this frustration with the modern world is prefabricated, let me assure you, it was homegrown in an artificial desert hellscape where flowers bloom in sand and hookers take you out to 29-cent breakfasts after breaking decomposing teeth off on your ballsack.  I mean, on their new record thereâs a song lamenting the loss of our free access to everything and anything in this world.  âAnd water is nextâ¦â Devin ominously forewarns.  Hey, like I said, Reno.  Theyâre fucking crazy out there, but thatâs rule number one of great art, man: Crazy is compelling.  They didnât teach you that in journalism school, did they?  Didnât think so.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
    Okay, Iâm just gonna go ahead and skip to talking about the new record nowâ¦Itâs called American Rubicon.  Know what that means?  Me either, but I think it has to do with being up against some seriously heavy shit, you know, passing the point of no return as a nation, and all that.  Or maybe on a smaller scale, as individuals.  Sheesh, man.  Donât make me figure all this out.  Thatâs why art is such a many-splendored flower, bro.  Itâs open to interpretations the likes of whichâ¦ Look, thatâs not important, letâs just say that Devin screams in both English and Argentinean Spanish over a dangerous combination of the Misfits, Chuck Berry, and the Clash about heavy duty topics ranging from his personal experience working for the ACLU when a discharged vet told him the story of being so bummed out with the war in Iraq that he purposely got a DUI while on patrol in order to get sent home (beats shooting off your toe), to lamentations about the state of Americaâs docile masses, to the aforementioned tale of our doomed free tap water, to straight up love songs.  This isnât the kind of stuff thatâs easy to classify which is exactly why the Cobra Skulls are so worth hearing, and also exactly why theyâre so awesomely scary.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
    But hey, donât take my word for it.  Check âem out yourself.  Theyâre always on the road.  This year, theyâll be out with Anti-Nowhere League, The Lawrence Arms, and Teenage Bottlerocket, just to name a few.  Go see âem scare the hot water right out of you while Devin screams âEven though my hands prepared the food you eat, you wouldnât stop and shake it if you saw me on the streetâ over Chadâs pummeling and Adamâs axe mastery (Yeah, I said axe mastery.

    What else, theyâre on tour like crazy, they, themselves are crazy, uhâ¦mentioned the mustache, mentioned Justin Timberlakeâ¦uh, OH!  Yeah, Alternative Press named Cobra Skulls a âBand To Watchâ, and none of these dudes even have that Jen Anniston haircut thing that is so big in that magazine, so this is a recommendation based on actual chops, innovation, and real, honest-to-god skull fucking ass kickery.  Trust me, man.  Thereâs no media-savvy corporate machine behind these guys. I mean, have you read their bio?				</description>

    <description>
					Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night with a hook just eating away at your mind? Half delusional as you stagger out of bed, you stumble on top of last week's dirty laundry. You pick up a pen before flattening out the back of an old receipt to write on. You finally catch your balance at the counter. You scribble out the fleeting thought...&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Disoriented once again, you wake up. Before you even shift your body weight, you notice that your hand is clenched. Once you relieve the pressure, you see the receipt covered with illegible lines. You spend your morning deciphering that thought. Frustrated, you call up a friend. He fills in the gaps. That's Coffee Project. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The self-proclaimed "mini-band" began a few years ago at a pool in Gainesville, Florida with a simple three-chord song about Richmond, Virginia. The duo includes Less Than Jake's trombonist Buddy Schaub and fellow Gainesville musician Jake Crown. Despite their involvement in multiple other groups, both are excited to use Coffee Project as an outlet for creative energy and an experiment in songwriting. You will be happy to know that Buddy &amp; Jake's repertoire has expanded to include ditties about coping with change, bad relationships with girls and good ones with their pets. 				</description>

					âLow aim, not failure, is the crime.â &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
âBruce Lee&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Dan Padilla is Gene Doney, Davey Quinn, J Wang, and Matty. They live in San Diego, California and formed in 2005. Davey and J. are also in Tiltwheel. Geneâs a full-time graphic designer. Mattyâs in Madison Bloodbath.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In every town or city with a DIY punk scene, thereâs always a small core of people who continually get shit done. For going on two decades, members of Dan Padilla have been setting up and running shows, recording, helping touring bands with food, floors, and friendship. Theyâve been all-around DIY ambassadors. They also all like to drink. A lot. Like âafter this case and the next case, we only have three cases and a couple 750s. Weâre running lowâ drinking. This isnât boasting, competitive drinking. Often, itâs not fun drinking.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Letâs face it. If youâre over thirty, have moved out of your parentsâ house, and come to realize that âanarchy!â means no bridges, public libraries, streets, or fire departments, idealismâs a much harder pill to swallow; especially when youâre looking at it through possible liver damage. But the dudes in Dan Padilla have fought hard to remain ethical, moral, and honest well after more vocal members of the DIY punk community have âmoved onâ to the comfort and status quo they once claimed to despise and swore theyâd âburn to the ground.â Dan Padilla just wants some public space and the freedom to play what theyâve createdâ¦ and the cops can still go fuck themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Itâd be pretty hard to find four other guys whose musical self-depreciation matches their talent for rough-hewn, yet melodic music. And letâs make sure weâre all wearing the same watches: Dudes in this band preceded the existence of Hot Water Music, so roll any bandwagons back into the barn.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Dan Padilla play punk that could be soul. It could also be country. Itâs versatile. It doesnât contradict the spirit of either Naked Raygun or Otis Redding while embracing both in completely unobvious ways.  Itâs gruff-voiced, cuddly underbelly, hard-earned DIY punk with secret, catchy-yet-twisted, and drought-hardened guitar lines that scrape the listener like running through a dense copse of chaparral.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Burritofornia will ever been in their debt and probably wonât ever know it.				</description>

    <description>
					David Dondero is a modern-day troubadour, a minstrel, a bard, a rolling stone, a traveling wilbury -- he gets around, and wherever he goes, he makes music. He's been getting around to odd parts of America, making music -- of a primarily transient, narrative, and acoustic variety, in the tradition of great American troubadours of decades past -- since the early '90s. Originally he did it with a band called Sunbrain, with whom he recorded three albums, before opting to go it alone. Since that decision, Dondero has recorded seven studio albums and one live album. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Most striking about Dondero's music is his voice -- which isn't the most tuneful, but is confident, varied, emotional, and direct, nicely suiting his musical style -- and his great guitar fingerpicking, which sometimes sounds like it came straight out of the Appalachian mountains, sometimes sounds bluesy, and sometimes even sounds vaguely classical. Other stark instrumentation -- lonesome accordion, harsh echoing percussion, and most of all, lots of fiddle -- connects Dondero further with the American folk tradition. Some songs are rock-minded, some desolate and hushed, some are detached, some extraordinarily confessional, some are twisted, some straightforward, some are happy, and some sad. But all bear the mark of a quality songwriter who knows a thing or two about living.				</description>

					Do you remember punk rock? No, we're not talking about the watered-down, homogenized version that dominates corporate-run radio stations and glossy magazines, we're talking about music that challenges the conventions of what the medium can achieve as an honest form of artistic expression. For the past six years, San Francisco's Dead To Me have carried on the same tradition as bands like the Clash and the Pogues as they've crafted a unique brand of dub-inflected punk rock that's unlike anything else currently happening in the music world. âWe never thought about getting signed or going on tour, we just wanted to hang out and play music for a few hours after work,"Â explains bassist/vocalist Chicken who formed Dead To Me with Jack and Brandon of the then-recently defunct street punk act One Man Army in 2003. âI feel lucky for every second I've experienced in this band.Â  				</description>

					Have you ever held a conch shell up to your ear so you can hear the ocean's quiet roar? This DEAR LANDLORD record is kinda like that, but instead you've woken up bleary-eyed on a dirty couch, stumbled out the front door into the brightly burning 2PM sun, found an empty 40 oz bottle laying in the dirt and held it up to your ear. The echoes of last night's blackout pour forth and suddenly foggy memories snap sharply into focus. Pangs of regret stab you in the gut like a knife to the back and you start to wonder where it all went wrong. DEAR LANDLORD are here to remind you. Bordering on super-group status with members of Illinois power-pop masterminds THE COPYRIGHTS and Minneapolis Weasel-worshippers RIVETHEAD, they carry the torch high, burning brightest when they step to the mic together for anthemic choruses cut by snotty leads and broken wrists flying at breakneck speeds. Sign up and cast off, because if you're holding this in your hands you're probably as fucked as them. You just don't know it yet. 				</description>

					Defiance, Ohio bridge two very distinct musical camps " the fun camp" and the"we're talking about serious stuff camp."Â Through joyful sing-a-longs and raucous anthems, they fly a banner of political activism and personal introspection. By and large, their musical stylings land firmly in the upbeat and jovial arena, although their newest record finds the band venturing into slightly uncharted waters on a few songs, introducing more confident and eclectic instrumentation than their previous works. Lyrically, Defiance, Ohio continue their progression since "Share What Ya Got" as a hopeful and inspirational spirit continues to dominate their songs despite creeping undertones of fear, paranoia, and anger.				</description>

					Dickkicker is a three-piece metal band from Tallahassee, FL.  The band, influenced by all kinds of heavy music (and a little bit of Hum), has toured with fellow Tallahasseeans Little League, The Stillmen, and Bleeder (members of Dickkicker are in each of those bands).  They will soon embark on a 3-week east coast tour with Liquid Limbs (members of Dickkicker love that band).  Their new EP, "Somniloquent," will be released in September on Tallahassee label Gaines Street Records.  				</description>

    <description>
					Are they punks? Are they furious road warriors? Are they hardened would-be gangsters who simply got caught up listening to the wrong kind of music at an early age? Yes, yes, and probably. Earning their bloodstripes through aggressive hustling in their formative years, by their early twenties they found themselves lost to the road. Adrift, they floated between bands as little more than mercenaries. Eventually finding themselves embittered and weary of the professional punk circuit, Dirty Tactics retooled and reconveined, freshly blood bound to follow the beat of their own drum. Their ethic is both unquestionable and uncompromising -one that few would dare to emulate. The driving tempos and contagious vocal melodies are harnessed by masterful songcraft, a clever comandeering of the skills they learned during their time in high-profile bands. In swaths of brutal honesty they hold true to their tastes, bejewelling their album with subtle layers of keys and back-ups, unafraid to embrace the more pop-oriented facets of their collective backgrounds while holding fiercely true to the genre. In both art and form they now flex their once-bound brawn, delivering a commanding album that is as exhubrant and liberating as it is well-crafted and conceived. As an added bonus, no matter where you're reading this from, they're probably making plans to come visit sometime soon.				</description>

    <description>
					Though the band formed in Nashville in 2007, if you didn't know any better you would swear Dolarhyde was some So-Cal band from the mid 90's you must have skipped over when you were picking up Punk in Drublic at the record store. With a sound that fits right in with the Epitaph/Fat Wreck Chords glory days of pop-punk, Dolarhyde combines short, fast song structures with catchy hooks that will stick in your head for days. Throw in a dash of east coast melodic HC style (think Lifetime, lots of Lifetime), and Dolarhyde will have you wishing Warped Tour was still good in no time. Since recording an 11 song demo in 2007 the band has done several tours throughout the US, put out a split cassette with Boston, MA's now deceased Frogball, and released a self-titled 14 song debut LP on State of Mind Recordings. The band also just finished recording a brand new 4 song 7 inch for Fat Sandwich Records. All you really need to know is, if you can still remember blaring bands like Lagwagon, No Use for a Name, and Ten Foot Pole through your portable CD player, you should throw on your dickies (if you can still find them) and give Dolarhyde a listen. 				</description>

    <description>
					Eric Ayotte currently lives in Bloomington, IN where he hosts a weekly dodgeball game, a monthly short movie challenge, and raging keggers at his place.  His songwriting is urgent and sincere, filled with nostalgia, vulnerability, and political undertones.  Due to a few states between them, a break from singing and playing guitar with Halo Fauna has put a larger focus on his solo music.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Eric splits his creative energy between filmmaking and music.  He is the creator of The Gadabout Traveling Film Festival which has toured around the country, in classic punk fashion, for the past 9 years showcasing DIY short films.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"I recently picked up his album Wavering this week and it just made me feel inspired, and I realized that every time I hear his music I feel that way. It?s like suddenly I feel this empowerment to DO something, to make a difference. You see, Eric Ayotte is so much more than just a folk artist or singer songwriter. He has this amazing gift in the words he writes and the voice from which he delivers those words to really grab that part of you heart, your mind, your life that says ?WAKE UP, look at the world for what it truly is?. I?d assume its a combination of the passion he shares for the causes and issues he supports pouring out in his songs, his personal experience, and natural talent, but Ayotte is an artist that always leaves me amazed that I am still standing after hearing his music." - hipsterspinster				</description>

    <description>
					Those who believe the glory days of rebels in leather wielding angst driven street rock anthems are long gone, obviously have never witnessed this power trio. Unlike countless sugarcoated rockers you find so accessible, The F Bombers were made in the raw. Hailing from the underground scene of New Jersey they paved their own road not doing things to anyone's standard but their own. With time tested DIY ethics and more drive than a Hemi, this band is about as real deal as they come. Teaming up with Jailhouse Records for their first 7" vinyl release "Sick Of It All / Made of Gold", they let the music speak for itself and anyone within earshot is bound to get exactly what they are all about.				</description>

    <description>
					Hailing from Buffalo, NY, Failures' Union plays music reminiscent of much of the great indie and alt-rock of the 1990s. There are hints of The Lemonheads, Buffalo Tom, Guided by Voices and Superchunk layering their simple catchy songs. In other words, they sound like a band whose video you would have seen once in the middle of the night on 120 Minutes back in 1994. Either that or they may have been on a mix tape that Angela Chase made for one of her friends on My So Called Life.				</description>

    <description>
					Where to begin? So I'm like all the rest, I saw an Iron Maiden poster when I was about 12 years old, and obviously thought it was cool as hell. When someone told me it was a poster for a band, well, that was me sold. My parents worried that I might be sidetracked from becoming a doctor / lawyer / whatever, and hey, they were right. So I soldiered through metal into punk rock, after a girl I met on holiday gave me a Black Flag album. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Several terrible bands and many even worse haircuts later, I found myself singing for a band called Million Dead. We were around for four years, from 2001-2005, and in that time we released 2 albums to 'critical acclaim' and 'underground success' (i.e. we weren't exactly U2). Nevertheless, we made a lot of friends and played a lot of shows, wrote a lot of songs and learnt an awful lot about playing music and making a living out of it. In the end we decided it would be best to part ways before we fell out and while we still had a chance of being a wicked underground band that no one liked at the time a decade hence (see: Slint).&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
So, after being chewed up and spat out by touring in hardcore, I decided it was time for something new. Remembering old Counting Crows, Johnny Cash and Weezer records that I'd hidden from my scene police friends, I started playing shows on my own with just an acoustic guitar, which also handily meant I didn't have to form a new band and deal with those kind of politics. I'm not sure I was planning on doing it for very long, but somewhere in the middle of it all I found out that folk music can be more punk than punk, and I think I found my voice. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In line with this new idea, I decided to do a Woody Guthrie and tour for ages. I spent about 18 months taking the train with a guitar and a small bag around the UK, selling CDRs and playing bars, bedrooms, squats, parties, whatever. The good folks at Xtra Mile Recordings took notice (and didn't think I was crazy, like everyone else) and put out first an EP, and then an album, Sleep Is For The Week, in 2007. By that time I'd toured in Europe and the States as well, and shared stages with everyone from Get Cape Wear Cape Fly to The Automatic to Jonah Matranga. I was surprised to get nominated for an XFM New Music Award, but pleased not only to be able to keep touring, but also to tour with a band (members of Oxford's Dive Dive). We also started sleeping in beds and traveling in vans with seats, just like Motley Crue.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Somewhere in the year of touring that followed, I managed to write a second album, Love Ire &amp; Song. Ben Lloyd, my live guitarist, took me down to a farm in Winchester in late 2007 where we recorded it in between US tours. We managed to get it released in the UK in March 2008, just over a year after its predecessor, and that's when things started getting a little crazier. The tours started selling out and getting bigger. The summer saw me playing a frankly ridiculous 26 festivals, whilst somehow managing to tour Europe as well. The single "Long Live The Queen" was released as a charity single and got picked up by daytime Radio 1. After a spell on Chuck Ragan's Revival Tour in the states, the next UK tour was my biggest yet, and saw me sleeping in beds not shared with another band member! "Reasons Not To Be An Idiot" was even bigger, hitting the Radio 1 B List and getting some TV syncs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Things really got out of hand (in an excellent way) in early 2009. After a manic European tour with new friends The Gaslight Anthem, and a pretty hectic SXSW (including one drunken tattoo of Texas..!) followed by another short US tour, we signed a deal with the legendary Epitaph Records to release my stuff outside the UK. This is the stuff of dreams, and I celebrated by sleeping in a star shape in a big double bed on my own. Much refreshed, I hit the studio with the great Alex Newport, first in the UK with my live band, and then in Brooklyn NYC for the vocals and the mix. Poetry Of The Deed is due for worldwide release on September 8th 2009 in between US and European Tours. The October UK run is selling out already, 4 months up front. I'm considering a waterbed. Onwards and upwards.				</description>

					Fred Oakman is a singer/songwriter who hails from the hills of Pennsylvania. He has successfully been able to mesh his love of indie/punk with his appreciation of traditional songwriting. Fred tours in support of this project and is currently writing / recording new material for an upcoming full length record.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In 2009 he independently released a split CD with his long-time friend Dan Gribbin under the moniker "Weekends". Since then he has dropped the moniker and has just finished recording a follow up EP titled "The God Fearing Boy." Fred is actively searching for interested labels to help him release his music to the world.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The song "Tired, Weak, and Poor" was released in 2009 on a Broken Teeth compilation, the song was also released an online compilation put out by Disconnect Disconnect Records in the UK. A track from the Weekends / Fleets split record titled "They Cannot Kill Me" is featured on the soundtrack to the movie "Prime of Your Life." &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"...The unique combination of vocals and instrumentals is initially shocking, but develops well to become extremely powerful." &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
- Brett Praskach | revolt-media.com&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"I particularly recommend listening to the song âSomething New,â which reminds me quite of a bit of TIM BARRY" &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
- Jordan Baker | Pastepunk.com&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Fred also plays and writes for the band Signal Home, and was a member of the now defunct The Twirpentines.				</description>

					Primal forces collide to form an elemental beast; A kraken? Nay. A griffin? Not quite. No, GATORFACE is a different creature entirely. Legend claims that a Floridian swamp-witch summoned the beast by stewing equal parts alligator toes, shark teeth, puppydog tails, and dragon scales. From the sickly green steam grew the monster itself, a chameleon of sorts. Bearing similar patterns to the four-headed serpent NEW MEXICAN DISASTER SQUAD from whence their rhythm section was birthed, GATORFACE embrace the warmth and familiarity of razor-sharp pop-punk, utilizing a forward phalanx of searing guitars and snotty, yet earnest, vocals. Bearing its teeth at just the right moments, Wasted Monuments percolates just below the boiling point, spitting and seething at the seams as the band wrestles the brute into submission. Nesting among the strip malls and stucco wasteland of Orlando, FL, these four souls have fought tooth and nail to carve their own lair amidst the plastic dreamland of their hometown. Having now tested their mettle in battle, they stand ready to lay seige to the masses, beginning with the searing barrage that is Wasted Monuments followed swiftly by a crusade of appearances along the East Coast as 2010 continues to unfurl.				</description>

					GHASTLY CITY SLEEP is one of those bands where the timeless adage âwriting about music is like dancing about architectureâ comes to mind. Itâs fundamentally pointless, especially when it comes to a band like this. Reams of paper could be written up and they still wouldnât encapsulate the dense, lush, and often subtle textures that comprise this Brooklyn quartetâs true sound. A precursory scan of Google results might produce comparisons to MOGWAI or a âheavierâ RADIOHEAD, as if it were easy to pin down those bands in the first placeâ¦&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
As with the vast majority of bands I choose to work with, Iâve had the great fortune of being able to watch the musical journey of the members of this band in particular evolve and take shape for over a decade. GHASTLY CITY SLEEPâs roots can be traced all the way back to a truly visceral and grimy teeth-cutting era that saw Brandon Evans performing in KILARA (alongside C.B. Houck) and PG.99, while co-founder Pat Broderick was blasting away behind the drum kit for MAJORITY RULE.  Progression found both Evans and Broderick doing extensive tenures in the unquestionably groundbreaking genre-bending hybrid act CITY OF CATERPILLAR while Evans also moonlighted in purveying the down-tempo, gorgeous melodies of GREGOR SAMSA.  The current lineup finds Ryan Parrish (of DARKEST HOUR, YEARS, SUPPRESSION) replacing Broderick on drums, a slightly ironic move considering that it was Broderick who replaced Parrish on drums in CITY OF CATERPILLAR. Incestuous? Yes. Brilliant musicians across the board? Set your watch to it.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Moondrifts is the first full length from the band and their first output for Magic Bullet.  Created over the better part of a year with Andrew Schneider behind the boards, itâs truly a work of art from start to finish. The amount of refinement honed by the collective members over the many years of crafting records and crashing on floors both apart and collectively shines like a great beacon across the saturated seas of newer and more derivative bands going for whatGHASTLY CITY SLEEP truly delivers to listeners.  From the chilling opener âI Never Left My Headâ all the way through to the stirring conclusion found in âShake the Somber Away,â Moondrifts is an entire album of unclassifiable music that pushes everything forward whilst simultaneously feeling like an old friend.				</description>

    <description>
					Mixing pedal steel and other traditional instrumentation with bending and crashing electricguitars, Glossarys spirited, American rock &amp; roll speaks loudly to those beyond the southernregionÌ¶those who relate to the great communicators like Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen andOtis Redding. Joey Kneisers cracked voice, complemented by Kelly Kneisers relaxed, creamyvocals, creates an everyman musical quality able to fit the passing night through a car window,or a rowdy beer swilling get-together. The group has shared the bill with everyone from southernrockers the Drive-By Truckers to the punk-spirited Against Me! and been embraced as musicalfamily by their crowds.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Produced by Centro-matic drummer and recording guru Matt Pence, and released on sisterband Lucero s label, Liberty &amp; Lament, Feral Fire was recorded in ten days and encapsulatesGlossarys unremitting musical drive---one that involves playing and creating for the sake ofsimply playing and creating. In fact, the five-piece from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, has beenreleasing records both independently and on labels for over a decade. In 2007, the bandposted its previous record, The Better Angels of Our Nature, online free of charge to gratifiedfanfare.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Feral Fire sees a band full of pop music junkies (with a soft spot for both underground musicand 80s country radio) delving into multiple genres. The soul-soaked Pretty Things is a lovesong pointed at a materialistic girl coming to grips with her own identity, while the jaunty,rebellious Save Your Money for the Weekend chronicles a rough-and-ragged southernerpleading with a waning Christian girl to shed her inhibitionsÌ¶kind of a southern version of BillyJoel s Only the Good Die Young . The latter includes the affectionately irreverent line, All Iknow is southern girls are sweeter cause theyre full of Jesus love, and seems to resurrect thespirit of Thin Lizzys Phil Lynott.In the albums raucous lead-off track, Lonely is a Town, Kneisers lyrics take a moresupernatural route, almost questioning the idea of where the body and the soul meet.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
It is really just figuring out everything is so massive and you re so small, says Kneiser. Youlive in this physical world and there are things you don t understand and things you will probablynever understand. Coming to terms with the fact that you just don t have any control is prettyhard to accept.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
You can sit around and pine over bad things happening to you or you can stand-up, saysKneiser. I overheard an old southern woman say, You just got to bend with the breeze. Ithought, Man, you better bend with the breeze or it will break you. Bad things are going tohappen it s inevitable. But, what are you going to do? You still got to wake up in the morning.				</description>

					Umm, hmm. We're The God Damn Doo Wop Band from Minneapolis, MN. We play doo wop as well as a you would think a doo wop group would with god damn in the title. I guess we do pop songs with 3 girls singin' em at the same time. Last year we made Racket Magazine's Runner Up for Best of the Fest right under Underground Railroad to Candyland, which we thought was sweet (especially since we didn't even play Fest, and will totally take runner up to Todd C. any day). What we don't do is write bios. We don't know how. Uhh, we got 3 lady singers (including Annie of the Soviettes, as well as lesser known Kat and Kiera), as well as guitar (by Downstairs Dave), bass (by Jesse of the Slow Death this year), and drums (by Mikey Erg who's in 1/4 of the bands you'll probably watch). Is that 500 words yet? Don't care. Doo Wop. Fuck yeah. The End.				</description>

    <description>
					Since 2007, Greenland is Melting have put their own spin on folk, bluegrass, punk; penning an original sound with straightforward, hometown lyrics. Hailing out of Gainesville, Karl, Shaun, and Will have always approached their music with a drive and direction that perpetuates real, honest experiences put into porch-driven sing-along's. This especially rang true with their October 2008 debut self-release, "The Measure of A Man's Worth." Recorded in various bedrooms and bathrooms, these DIY recordings set some serious groundwork for the band as they honed their aesthetic and took their songs to the road. With extensive southeast touring under their belts, the trio not only found themselves with countless stories and experiences that paved the way for their new full-length, but an ever growing audience to woo with their earnest fervor and alluring three-part harmonies. Armed with banjos, harmonicas, a suitcase bass drum, and a slew of other instruments in tow, the Greenland boys break the typecast we all know as the "Gainesville sound"Â and bring a breath of fresh, folk-induced air to the masses. With an already large following due to their heartfelt performances and relentless work ethic, Greenland is Melting is more than ready to bring their sound to your back porch, kitchen, or basement. Their new full-length, appropriately titled "Our Hearts Are Gold, Our Grass is Blue,"Â was recorded by Gainesville's own Rob McGregor (Against Me,Whiskey &amp; Co., Hot Water Music,) and out now on Paper + Plastick Records.				</description>

					Ultra-distorted, grimy, feedback drenched noise punk from Charlotte, NC.  Drawing comparisons from bands like Cherubs, Pissed Jeans and Brainbombs; their music is a sledgehammer.  Ugly and confrontational, repetitive and crushing.				</description>

					"We are talking, you and I, about the night before. Piecing it back together, as much as we can. Did you ever make to the burrito store? I ran out of cigarettes early. That girl from the party helped me out, more ways than one. Yeah. Glad to see you on the couch.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
That guy Brian Moss was out of control. Raving about Chicago and San Francisco. Were you there when he climbed the countertop, dropped his pants and sang Bear Force One? I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know if he got home alright or not, but he gave me this CD, I listened to it just now. YouÃ¢â¬â¢d expect it to be some heavy shit, right? From that dude. But itÃ¢â¬â¢s like he gave it to me because he knew how IÃ¢â¬â¢d be feeling this morning. PrescriptionÃ¢â¬âwhat does it say right there, in Sharpie?Ã¢â¬âHanalei: One Big Night.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
No, see, check it out. I have a theory. Everyone who plays an acoustic guitar is horrible except people who were or are in punk bands. He was talking about the Fireside Bowl, remember? Listen to this, Ã¢â¬ÅMoth to the Flame.Ã¢â¬Â HeÃ¢â¬â¢s screaming his guts out over these pretty angelic guitars. Then just a couple songs later heÃ¢â¬â¢s on this long poetic tip, unreeling lines about trust and mercy and love and sordid pasts when really it seems like heÃ¢â¬â¢s preparing for his own sordid future. No, I didnÃ¢â¬â¢t find out where he lived. He said something about recording it&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
at his house.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
I donÃ¢â¬â¢t know, man. I donÃ¢â¬â¢t really want to live better, like they say. I just want to live smarter. Know what I mean? I want to walk that jagged line along insane hope and, I dunno, inevitable malaise. Listen to this guy singing. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s like he knows his core, or his home, even if he forgot how it was built. I wish all acoustic guitar players were like this.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Man, he was cracking me up so hard last night. With the Bear Grylls Man vs. Hood thing... Oh, hey, do you have that girl's number? I think I lost my phone somewhere in an alley off of San Pablo again."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					"Laura and I have always been fans of punk rock from before we even started listening to heavy metal," says Murray. "From the time we were 13 years old our favorite bands have been Bad Religion, Strung Out, Propagandhi, etc. We had never stopped enjoying and following punk rock, so when we were tired of playing melodic death-metal it was obvious what direction we wanted to strive for musically. The passion and emotion that we can express through punk rock is definitely unlike any other genre of music, and we are having the time of our lives so far!"&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The best friend duo spent the beginning of 2009 writing and entered the studio that summer with former Light This City producer Zack Ohren to record their debut album.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"We wanted to create this record in a zone where we were totally comfortable, and Zack was definitely the man for the job," says Murray. "The recording process went really smooth, as it was just Laura and I in the studio considering I tracked the drums, bass, and lead guitar as well. As for vocals, our good friend Nick Diener of The Swellers flew out to help us with vocal production, which ended up being really beneficial. After all is said and done, we think the record came out great and can't believe how positive of a reaction it's gotten."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;em&gt;Until We Surrender&lt;/em&gt; is a heart-pounding throwback to 90's punk era, focused on the faster and more technical aspects of its style with elements of pop-punk and indie sensibilities all mixed in together. Murray and Nichol's back and forth vocals complement each other immensely, while their warm rhythmic riffs intertwine for a fresh take on the classic punk sound. Murray put's it best in his lyric "I've found my true calling, and it's never sounded so fucking good."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Featuring tracks like "The Song Inside Me," "Reoccurring Grey," "Walking Dead" and "Our Last Hope," &lt;em&gt;Until We Surrender&lt;/em&gt; proves without a doubt that Heartsounds have found their true calling.				</description>

&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Hellmouth is misanthropy. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Hellmouth's hometown has been ranked one of the top ten worst cities on Earth. Bad Religion asked, "how could hell be any worse?" on their first record...they clearly hadn't been to the modern day Sodom and Gommorah we call Detroit. Hellmouth is bombs, death, unemployment, corruption, sex and politics. Hellmouth is both anti-christ and anti-human. Hellmouth is an ugly fucking place to call home. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The four horsemen from Detroit are drawing on their combined years of devastation in the punk, hardcore and metal communities since the 80's to put forth the most extreme and uncompromising band of its members' careers. With nods to bands like Celtic Frost, Black Flag, Venom, Nuclear Assault and Disfear; Hellmouth is drawing from its members' past while carving its own disgusting future. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After signing to Ferret Records within a week of releasing their demo, Hellmouth unleashed their debut album, "Destroy Everything. Worship Nothing" to a growing international cult of followers. The Church protested in '09, riots broke out at shows (Detroit doomed to repeat itself whether it's '67 or '07), Hellmouth was banned from the pubs for being a public threat and yet still managed to spread its plague and slaughter the herd of non-believers. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Hellmouth has annihilated stages from the slums of Brooklyn to punk squats in Chicago and laid waste to bands from Toronto to Philly and from Cleveland to the battlefields of Detroit. They've played with the likes of the Cro-Mags, Agnostic Front, Ringworm, Mayhem, Marduk, Negative Approach, MDC, Nachtmystium and many more. The death-toll increases with every show as the True Cult ov Hellmouth play like each day is their last. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After living in darkness for far too long, Hellmouth is about to d-beat listeners to death with the second album in their fucked-up arsenal of doom, thrash, death and destruction. Picking up where "D.E.W.N." left off, the second slab of wax will continue to bang the heads that will not bang.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Fuck Armageddon...this is Hellmouth.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					This three-piece is returning to the Fest hot on the heels of their recent full length on Houseplant/Recess.  After playing together for years, the band released their first full-length in 2005 while living in their Cleveland, MS hometown. After moving to Athens, GA and picking up bassist Ian McCord from the band CARRIE NATIONS, they cranked up the volume and speed on their next two 7"s. Some time slipped by while the members each played with other bands (NANA GRIZOL, SHITTY DARKNESS, AMERICAN CHEESBURGER) but returning to the fold has resulted in some of their best work yet.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Razorcake:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The Hot New Mexicans play ragged, melodic, approachable DIY punk that reminds me of scuffed floors, long drives, cracked-open beers, proportionately incorrect tattoos of bands from the Ã¢â¬Ë90s, cracking-open-the-sky sunsets, secrets and stains rolled up in frayed carpets, hairy dogpiles, body odor, and the really beautiful parts to *Tortilla Flats*. Like when the house burns down and no one gets too mad because itÃ¢â¬â¢s just a house and not the people inside of it.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
MRR:  This release is typical of the Recess catalog, displaying the catchiness of swine flue along with hints to the spazz of the BANANAS, the soft garage fuzz of THEE MAKE OUT PARTY! and the cute melody of the GRUMPIES. At times I can hear nudges to the BUZZCOCKS and, more surprisingly, even Sgt. Pepper-era BEATLES in HOT NEW MEXICANS' well-considered and skillful layering of melody and rhythm. Then, at other times it's as balls-out and rocking as THIN LIZZY. Fuck this is so good! All too often, punk can be mistaken for music that is sloppy, rushed and ill thought out. "First three chords we can half play--there, that's a song? Right?! 1-2-3-4" This LP is anything but that, featuring that combination of heart and balls.				</description>

					If death is coming, then Hour Of The Wolf is its messenger. Hailing from Prescott, Arizona, this punk outfit is this era's answer to The Misfits. Drawing other comparisons to the raw bitterness of Black Flag to the rock and roll solo's of Motorhead, HOTW are proving to be one of the most promising up and coming punk bands in the country. Described as being fun and energetic, the band builds on these attributes, and is proving to be an unstoppable machine. 				</description>

					How Dare You is a band from Florida.  Old, grumpy and tired.  Most of their time is spent watching the Phillies, changing diapers, sweep-picking metal riffs, and eating pizza... lots of pizza. The drummer Zach, can't eat pizza though.  When he eats cheese his ass turns into a fire hose and we don't see him for a few days.  Oh yeah, about the band.  Combine Hot Water Music sing along bro-choruses with Face to Face pop/punk melodies, add in a little golden girls camaraderie, and you get How Dare You. Now, who brought the beer?				</description>

    <description>
					Inspired in both execution and scope, Bow And Quiver is the newest document from the well-traveled imadethismistake and finds principal songwriter Kylewilliam Campol and crew at a creative apex, producing one of 2010's most striking releases. Ten propulsive, giant-sounding tracks flow effortlessly between shimmering post-punk numbers, angry folk rockers, intimate tales of redemption and rousing anthems dripping with both hope and dissent. The band's latest full-length is an amazingly cohesive effort that breathes new life into the album format and will surely inspire phrases like "career defining" to be bandied about by peers and critics alike. Campol's signature heart-on-sleeve, spoken-word / sung delivery is in full effect throughout Bow And Quiver. Unique in their simplicity, the vocals are penetrating on many levels, embracing anger, self-doubt, fragility and optimism all at once. The lyrics follow suit as well: straightforward and direct, but often relying on apocalyptic imagery and influenced by the grave consequences of the subject's choices. Bow And Quiver feels epic - like it's larger than life - yet the subject matter is largely inward-looking. Still, it's less a recounting of the narrator's journey and more about how that journey has shaped his life and continues to guide his actions. Musically, imadethismistake has upped the ante in a big way as well. It's no longer easily categorizable ... although it certainly feels like we should all start thinking of some new, readily available genre to do exactly that. A plaintive French horn in opener "New York" signals the change in approach, and while Campol continues to give nods to bands like Latterman and Against Me, Bow And Quiver also recalls '90s emo greats like The Van Pelt and former Tallahassee brethren Look Mexico. Ultimately, Bow And Quiver is less about punk's breakneck speed, power chords, pummeling bass or gang vocals-although those elements are used sparingly when necessarily. No, this is more punk rock in spirit, with a message delivered in gleaming instrumental passages, jangly guitars and the occasional piano flourish. It's filled with contemplative moments of restraint backed against outbursts of tense angularity and injected with urgency and an underlying rage. If that sounds like a tall order for any band to pull off, well it is ... But imadethismistake expertly matches both ambition and passion with action. Bow And Quiver is undoubtedly one of this year's most singular, memorable releases. Recorded in three different locations over the course of several months, Bow And Quiver was produced by Kylewilliam Campol, engineered by Mike Natoli ( from The Knockdown / Timeshares ) and mixed and mastered by George Zhen. The CD will be released on May 11th by Bermuda Mohawk Productions and there are plans for a vinyl version from Solidarity Recordings later this year as well.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					My name is Evan Thomas Weiss and this is Into It. Over It.  This one time I wrote, recorded and released one song every week for an entire year.  It was called 52 Weeks and released on 2 CD's by a label called No Sleep.  This other time I wrote twelve songs about twelve US towns.  Those songs were (and are) being released on six split 7" records with Bob Nanna, Castevet, Empire Empire, Pswingset, Everyone Everywhere and Snowing.  This other time I went on tour and played shows in 35 US states.  Then, this one time, I went to Europe and played 40 shows in 12 countries.  I used to play in bands called The Progress and Up Up Down Down Left Right Left Right B A Start, but that isn't too important.  I'm 25 years old.  I'm 6'2".  I'm a Libra.  I have a beard.  My shoes are a size 9.  I'm always busy.  I'm always broke.  I'm (almost) always happy.  I write songs.  Let's kick it.				</description>

    <description>
					Gloucester,Massachusetts can be a tough town. Born and raised in this small port town north of Boston, Jeff Rowe cut his teeth on punk rock. He and his band mates in the now defunct BoxingWater often sang about the frustrations and angst that comes along with an attempt to rise above a backdrop that's trying it's hardest to keep you down. And now, with a new clarity that perhaps comes with time and age, Rowe is telling these stories again.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Though comparisons and influences are inevitable, Rowe's brand of acoustic folk has a unique freshness. Without sounding contrived Rowe manages this familiar medium with a natural ease which, as it should be, allows his songs to be the center of our attention. Rowe's songs, though at times extremely personal, have a universality that allows the listener to not only glimpse Rowe's perspective but also urge a sort of self reflection on our part as well. There is no songwriter elitism here, just an honest attempt at showing that music can not only help, but perhaps heal. Frailty, anger, hope, all of which are conditions we all deal with are brought to the forefront in Rowe's music and they are dealt with an insight I believe we can all benefit from.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After spending several years in the southern heat of Richmond, Virginia bettering his craft, Rowe returned to Massachusetts and released his first acoustic music as one half of Tomorrow The Gallows, a duo consisting of Rowe and longtime friend Bertram Holdredge. Now, out on his own, Rowe has accumulated a catalog of literally hundreds of songs, a portion of which will be recorded back in Richmond, VA and released as his first proper solo effort.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The road awaits. More songs will be written, for Rowe hasn't spent the better part of his life writing and recording music for labels or deadlines or some silly form of status, but because he has too, just as surely as we all have to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					"The Jukebox Romantics are 5 certifiable and usually belligerent punk rockers from southern NY.  Since releasing their debut album on Altercation Records in 2009, the Jukebox Romantics have taken their talked-about live show from coast to coast including dates during Austinâs SXSW festival and the Warped Tour in the summer of 2010.  With a genre hopping approach to their sound, the Jukebox Romantics channel their influences of bands like The Clash, Bouncing Souls, and One Man Army through personal song writing and their ability and eagerness to be absorbed by their audiences.  The Jukebox Romantics will be entering the studio at the close of this year to record their second full length to be released in the late spring of 2011.  Look for them this year at The Fest 9 and Philadelphiaâs first FM Festival, or contact them directly to book a show in your neck of the woods."  				</description>

					henry 'obediah' barber was born in 1825. he fathered 20 children, was known for his skills as a bear hunter and fiddler, and the cabin he built on the okefenokee swamp is an historic landmark.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
i have not fathered, nor mothered any children. the only time i killed an animal was when i hit a deer in high school. i immediately threw up and started crying. i'd like to think, though, that my great, great, great, great grandfather would appreciate the fact the i write songs about hot weather, fearing the lord, rivers,  bad people, good people, people in hard times- swamp people, our people. 				</description>

    <description>
					Junior Battles is about connecting with the tiny, enthusiastic, sober 16 year-old buried deep inside each and every one of us. And then pouring 40s of Black Ice all over them, raging to old Punkorama comps all night, and passing out at dawn. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Since releasing Hotel Bibles on Toronto punk imprint Black Pint Records in April of last year, Junior Battles has turned into an unintentional road beast. Initially conceived as a lazy, friendly way to hang out and play throwback pop-punk, Junior Battles got a lot more real in the summer of 2009, clocking a girlfriend-troubling number of hours between Ontario, Quebec, and the East Coast of the U.S., all while learning to sleep in new, exciting positions on strange, foreign floors. Since then, they've bought a really old van, made a lot of new friends, and released a self-titled four-song 7" on Square Up Records and a split with O Pioneers!!! on Kiss of Death. Plus, they've eaten a morbid amount of Taco Bell. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Richmond, Virginia is one of the strongholds for punk on the east coast of the United States. In the Fall of 2005 a group of Richmond punk staples decided to collaborate on a new project. Thus, Landmines were born. A humble band, they might shrug at their ongoing comparisons to other hometown hardcore heroes Avail and Strike Anywhere. However, Landmines have also been known to take a page from bands such as Hot Water Music, Verbal Assault, The Bouncing Souls, Fifteen and Jawbreaker. With simple goals in mind, Landmines set out to play music for anyone that would listen. They quickly garnered attention after recording a limited release demo CD on Pop Faction Records in 2006. Vinnie Fiorello of Less Than Jake promptly scooped them up choosing Landmines to be the first release on his new label Paper + Plastick. Their self-titled full length (PP01), was critically acclaimed, helping the label hit the ground running. Characterized by "powerful shredding guitars and searing vocals" (canyouseethesunset.blogspot) it is easy to call Landmines "explosive, but at the very least, it's a scorching blast from a band that sound like they're just getting started" (gosleeveless.blogspot).   Don't expect this band to slow down any time soon. They're doing exactly what they set out to do: Playing fun songs with some of their best friends.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					Musical anthropologists interested in the study of just how fast a band can evolve need look no further than the six upright, upstanding men in Oregon's Larry and His Flask.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Formed by brothers Jamin and Jesse Marshall in 2003, the Flask (as the band's expanding army of fans calls them) spent its first half-decade stuck in a primordial, punk-rock goop, where a blood-sweat-and-beers live show took priority over things like notes and melodies. Don't misunderstand: The band was (somewhat) skilled and an absolute joy to watch, but the goal was always the party over perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Over the past two years, however, Larry and His Flask has gone from crawl to sprint at breakneck speed. First, Jamin Marshall moved from gargling-nails vocals to drums. Guitarist Ian Cook became the band's primary voice. And a trio of talented pickers and singers -- Dallin Bulkley (guitars), Kirk Skatvold (mandolin) and Andrew Carew (banjo) -- joined the family. (And no, you didn't miss something. No one is named Larry.)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Determined to make music for a living or die trying, the six brothers set out in a van, intent on playing for anyone, anywhere at any time. From coffee shops to dive bars and street corners to theater stages, the Flask honed their sound and show through experience, attacking each gig like buskers who must grab and hold the attention of passersby in hopes of collecting enough change to get to the next town.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
By 2009, Larry and His Flask's train began gaining steam. The band's new songs are a blurry blend of lightning fast string-band picking, gorgeous nods to old-school country, and sublime multi-part harmonies, all presented through a prism of punk chaos. The boys have grown and changed, yes, but their shows are still gloriously physical displays of live music's sheer power. In other words, keep your eyes peeled, or risk taking the heavy end of Jesse Marshall's flailing, stand-up bass right between the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
A slot supporting the Dropkick Murphys in the Flask's hometown led to an invitation to open for the Celtic punk kingpins across the eastern half of the United States, as well as an opportunity to finally record their new, twangier sound. The result is Larry and His Flask's three-song, self-titled 7" record, pressed in a limited run that's quickly being snapped up by the band's new fans, who've been clamoring for a sip of aural hooch to call their own.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In mid-2010, the Flask is holed up in their crash pad in Central Oregon, working on songs for their first full-length, playing gigs here and there, and, in the words of Jesse Marshall, "fixing the van and all our broken shit" in anticipation of the next leg of a lifelong tour. Keep up with the band's never-ending tour schedule at www.larryandhisflask.com.				</description>

					SLC's own violin driven art rock. Members of Loom have come together hailing from some of the finest local/touring bands such as Fear Before, Michigan, HerCandane, and The New Transit Direction (which featured members of The Used &amp; Form Of Rocket). &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
  Led by a skilled veteran on the pig skins, Clayton (Goose) Holyoak is a local celebrity due to the years of performing and musical experience that follows this well rounded drummer. Playing with Fear Before the March of Flames and Orbs (members of Between The Buried and Me and Cradle of Filth) has allowed Goose the chance to truly hone his skills. Josh Devenport and John Finn have become staples in the SLC area, playing in bands like Michigan and The New Transit Direction (which both featured members of The Used) have given them the opportunity to share the stage with larger touring bands, on a local and national level. And trained in the areas of jazz guitar at the young age of 13, Mike (the dork) is fully aware of how to impress an audience. With influences like, At The Drive-In, Botch, Bear Vs Shark and even Karate, LOOM has a sound that they can call their own. Fast. Melodic. Heavy 'n Hard. Powerful. A passion of music and fun, with a desire to succeed and tour as much as possible is what leads the path for Loom. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 If you like your post-hardcore techy, melodic and unique.. Loom is for you.				</description>

    <description>
					Athens, GA native Madeline Adams has been writing and performing her own songs since the age of 15, self-releasing her first album, "Kissing &amp; Dancing," in 2002 -- just two years into her career. A few short months later, the LP was picked up by punk label Plan-It-X Records. "Kissing &amp; Dancing" is now in its fifth pressing, and has earned her national recognition and a solid fan base. Madeline recorded one more album for the label, before moving on to Athens label Orange Twin, who have released works most notably by Sibylle Baier, Elf Power, Neutral Milk Hotel and Vic Chesnutt. Her 2006 Orange Twin release, "The Slow Bang," was produced by Matthew Houck (Phosphorescent), and recorded at his house in Athens. Though described in the past as a cross between The Softies, Kimya Dawson, and The Carter Family, Madeline now shares more in common with '70's superstars Joni Mitchell and Karen Carpenter. On her third full-length album, "White Flag," Madeline securely set herself apart from her peers through her intelligent, emotional lyrics, her clear, haunting voice, and her unique song writing.				</description>

					Hartford post-punkers MAKE DO AND MEND (MDAM) hit the studio in June to record their full-length debut, which will be released later this year via Paper + Plastick Records, in conjunction with the band's long-standing label, Panic Records. With plans to be locked away until July 6th, the quartet will split time with co-producers Nick Bellmore (Hatebreed, Kingdom of Sorrow, Death Threat) at Dexter's Lab in Milford, CT and Jason Maas (Bane, Verse, Title Fight) at Getaway Group studio in Wakefield, MA. With nearly a dozen songs ready to record that range in subject matter from isolation, to the trials and tribulations of playing in a touring band, vocalist/guitarist James Carroll confides "the sound is definitely more mature than anything from our previous EPs, but overall it definitely a MDAM record; very driving, heavy and filled with a lot of emotion."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"It's been exciting to watch MDAM grow as a band. We've become very good friends and the band itself has been a big part of Panic Records growth,"Ã?Â says Panic Records owner Timm McIntosh. "Our main priority at Panic Records is to help the bands on the label, and so it's a logical step to team up with Paper + Plastick to help continue MDAM's growth. I can't wait for this record to drop, everything MDAM touches is gold." Paper + Plastick Records owner Vinnie Fiorello adds "This collaboration is an exciting one for me and P+P. I love and respect Panic as a label, and to be able to work with them on such an amazing project like MDAM is inspirational and lends itself to the fact that the music scene doesn't have to be cutthroat to survive and thrive."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
MDAM exploded onto the scene with their sophomore EP, Bodies Of Water, which was offered to fans as a free download. The album was well received across the board and left ThePunksite to claim "[Bodies Of Water is] a cohesive piece of post-hardcore music that ebbs and flows with anticipation, passion and sincerity."Ã?Â In anticipation of their full-length, MDAM is releasing a split 7"Ã?Â with Touche Amore later this Summer on Panic Records/6131 Records.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Sometime at the turn of the century a small gang of boys living in and around Washington D.C. grouped together in the noble pursuit of transcending suburban boredom through the traditional performance of punk rock songs. 3 of these young products of white America never moved on from this adolescent rebellion phase, and 10 years later The Max Levine Ensemble continues to rock basements, bombed out buildings and other holes in the fabric of the status quo, with lofty aspirations of creating moments of pop catharsis for angsty teenagers and maybe shaking punk rock from the mediocrity of its ritualistic lulls. Which is to say, here's another punk rock band. You've definitely seen this before.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"Listening to this album is like taking a musical field trip lead by some bi-polar, schizophrenic, fourteen-year-old songwriting genius. The music is scribbly, scratchy pop punk that is octane-fueled with lots of noise and dynamics. Underneath a wall of onslaughting voices are some spastic melodies that perfectly frame the personal reveries. All the tracks feel like they have typical pop structures but they never play out quite as expected. It's a crazy ride, but if you haven't heard The Max Levine Ensemble getting this record is a trip worth taking." â??N.L. Dewart, Razorcake on "OK Smartypants"				</description>

					Upstate New York, specifically Syracuse is an area put on the map by it's distinguishing hardcore and metal, and not really it's cynical punk rock.  But from the harsh winter environment anything can grow given encouragement.  Mayflower was born in 2007 from late night sing-a-longs.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
During the winter of 2008-2009, Mayflower locked themselves in the studio to self produce and record a serious amount of material. This past spring saw the debut of their first LP, "Second Best Sunsets" co-released by the band and Kiss of Death Records.  Being fans of the long play format themselves they keep any listener on their toes by varying tempos, while keeping everything short and bitter.  With song topics varying from loving life, to political messages, to girls, to complaining about being broke, what more could you ask for in your punk rock?&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
A free download of "Second Best Sunsets" can be obtained at kissofdeathrecords.com&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					WHO:  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes are the consummate punk rock supergroup.  If underground music had an all-star game, these guys would lead the league in voting every season.  Beginning with vocal duties, we have Spike.  Spike got his break in the Fat Wreck Chords warehouse, where he was notorious for his violent outbursts and singing along to Prince records.  His sweet voice and charisma could not be overlookedâ¦the rest is history.  Spike also plays bass in the famed San Francisco streetpunk band the Swinginâ Utters.  On the tubsâthat means the drumsâwe have Dave, formerly of Santa Barbara greats, Rich Kids on L.S.D., and the current drummer for skate-punk torchbearers, Lagwagon.  On guitar we have Jackson.  Yeah, yeah, Jacksonâs in the Foo Fighters.  On bass thereâs Fat Mike, and if ever there was a punk tycoon, it would have to be he.  As frontman of NOFX and president of Fat Wreck Chords, this man is a veritable crimelord.  Heâs not Sicilian, heâs Jewish.  And finally, we have Joey on guitar.  As the singer/songwriter genius behind Lagwagon, this Santa Barbaran is a living legend and leader of the punk rock new school. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
WHEN:  In 1997 the Gimme Gimmes released a handful of 7âs on various labels before releasing their first full length, Have a Ball.  No one couldâve predicted the success to which that album was received, nor could anyone explain the phenomenon that swept the punk scene.  Two years later in 1999, the Gimme Gimmes returned with their second record Are a Drag.  On this album, the Gimmes took on the task of covering show tunes and punk-a-fying them.  Needless to say it was a success as they did everything from Grease to Annie to Evita.  2001 brought forth their third full length, Blow in the Wind, where they took a stab at 60âs classics from artists like the Beach Boys and Bob Dylan.  Then came Take A Break; 13 cover tunes that tackle R&amp;B greats like Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston, R Kelly, and more.  2005 gave us their live album, Ruin Jonnyâs Bar Mitzvah.  Really, they played a Bar Mitzvah and recorded the show.  After a crazy European tour in 2006, the Gimmes began work on their tribute to both kinds of music: Country and Western titled Love Their Country. Me First And The Gimme Gimmes are up to their old hijinks with the release of their 7th full length, Have Another Ball. In order to commemorate the 10th anniversary of their debut album, Have a Ball, the GIMMES are releasing the second installment of recordings from the original session.  Wait, say what?!? Yes, the wildly popular Have a Ball was initially recorded as a double album, but the band decided that the two disc extravaganza might be too much rock for the uninitiated masses. Subsequently there is another albumâs worth of material just waiting to be devoured by Gimmes fans, old and new. Have Another Ball is chock-full of 70âs classics from the likes of John Denver, Hall and Oates, Neil Diamond, and Elton John, with that distinctive GIMME GIMMES twist.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
WHY:  Me First and the Gimme Gimmes formed in 1995 in an effort to breath some punk rock life back into classic radio hits made famous by rock pioneers like Barry Manilow and Neil Diamond.  Getting together with friends and playing thoughtless music was the motivation for the Gimme Gimmes.  The Gimmes have broken down the barrier between the golden moldies and punk; finally a band that can be enjoyed kids and parents alike!   				</description>

					A Southern Ontario quartet. Playing sporadically in small spaces for several years, through borrowed vans and amps. Strained throats from punk rock; a catalyst for something vague and quieter and a good way to waste a couple summers.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The bands first E.P., Goodbye Debris was released last Autumn. 				</description>

    <description>
					Ryan, Mark, Kaz, and Scotty are a punk band. They play songs about drinking too much, working shitty jobs, attempting to recapture their lost youths, staying up all night and sleeping all day. Ryan cut his teeth playing with Florida heroes Discount for a long time. Heâ??s old now. He eventually decided to return to his former ethic, starting Monikers after years (and one terrible electronic record) living abroad in Scotland.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Mark and Kaz have been around the gloryhole of the punk scene over the last decade, so they have lots of funny stories. Scotty (aka Scotty College) is probably the most famous punk in the whole of Florida. He can drink a whole lot and can yell â??Skinhead!â?? loud as hell.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They are big fans of hanging out and proud purveyors of Natural Ice. With â??Wake Upâ??Â now in the hands of fine people everywhere, Monikers are prepared to cement their place in history as one of many fish swimming in the sea of pop-punk bands with gritty vocals and cynical lyrics.				</description>

					Philadelphia's Mose Giganticus conjure a new breed of floor rumbling, heavy music by merging thunderous, gritty synthesizers and expansive electronics with driving guitar hooks and powerful drums. After touring North America relentlessly in their waste vegetable oil fueled bus for 2008's Commander!, including shows in Alaska and the Yukon, Mose Giganticus return to the scene with their epic Relapse Records debut, Gift Horse. Armed with a keytar and vocoder as his unusual weapons of choice, frontman and mastermind Matt Garfield has developed Mose Giganticus into a genre bending hybrid of synthesizer infused sludge metal and hard rock, offering a fresh personality to the heavy music-scape.				</description>

    <description>
					Mouthbreather started on the beautiful day of August 14th 2007. It was&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
a quite sunny day, just like any other day in Richmond, Virginia; a&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
perfect day to fly a medium-sized vibrant rainbow butterfly kite. But&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
instead, John Hall and John Martin (yes, they're sisters) started to&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
become inquisitive about their new Apple desktop and decided to&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"[expletive] around" on Garageband. After two hours of intense&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
physical labor filled with blood, sweat and [expletive], they came up&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
with the first hit, 'I Like Money.' They decided that maybe since the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Garageband loops and vocal recordings (aka yelling at the Apple&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
desktop monitor since they had no recording system whatsoever) were SO&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
AMAZING, they should make a music Myspace. They realized, upon&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
creating the Myspace, that they did not have an extravagant name to go&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
along with their new hit. The two quickly decided upon Mouthbreather&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
because it tied into the name of the song, 'I Like Money.' Within&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
hours after posting the first song, they received a [expletive] load&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
of online attention and within weeks, were already on the Myspace Top&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Artist Charts.				</description>

    <description>
					At last year's Fest, at an afterparty in northwest Gainesville, a drunken Nato Coles was playing the Nigel Tufnel solo classic "Lick My Love Pump" (in D Minor) on an acoustic keytar to a crowd of three passed out Festgoers and a dog that wouldn't stop barking.  A fellow staggered up to him and said, "hey, are you Nato from the Modern Machines?"  Nato replied "nope, I killed him and ate his brain.  Who the hell are you?"  The fellow responded, "uhhh... call me Mike... Cranberry.  Yeah, that'll do."  That night, a bond was forged between Mr. Coles and Mr. Cranberry that would one day result in the birth of the Blue Diamond Band!  St. Paddy from Dillinger Four once called Nato Coles "the broke man's Greg Cartwright" to his face, then bought a t-shirt, making him slightly less broke.  If that means something to you, then don't miss the high energy rock'n'roll sonic sweat pouring from the speakers when Nato and the Blue Diamond Band take the stage at Gainesville Fest IX.  The set list is made up of lots of new songs, and some so-called chestnuts from Nato's old bands (Used Kids, Radio Faces, and the Mo-Macs).  Word on the street is that Nato Coles and the Blue Diamond Band does a Tom Petty cover, and it makes Ninja Gun's TP cover sound like elevator music recorded by chipmunks!  (That's what they're saying in Georgia, anyways).  Nato will also be playing a solo set this year, so if the band doesn't play enough of your requests, you can go yell them at Nato and he will have no excuse not to play them for you.				</description>

    <description>
					Ninja Gun accomplishes something not many other bands are doing these days; writing catchy, melodic and well-thought out rock and roll songs. Ninja Gunâ??s Southern upbringing resonates throughout each song alongside a mischievous rebellious streak: the same mixture of discordant ideals that gave rise to rock and roll in the â??40s and â??50s. And while Ninja Gunâ??s music is packed with sing-along choruses, the lyrics often run deeper than the average radio-friendly hit. At times they are political, personal and often laced with cynical Southern commentary showcasing a great sense of humor that will shine through from stage, photo shoots, and late night sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
From poignant political jabs from a self-proclaimed â??rubeâ??Â to songs about escaping the fate of life growing up in the only town you know. Chasing destiny to change the path of the working class routine. Keeping faith in something: be it love, hard times, family, friends or good tunes played from the heart on the front porch. Restless RubeÂ allows you to feel the plight of the Southern small town working class band.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Musically they have more in common with 70â??s power pop and Southern classic rock than punk rock, often turning gospel-inspired melodies back on themselves with an attack from a powerful distorted riff, leaving you only to be captured later by the memory of a chorus you just canâ??t shake. â??Restless Rubeâ??Â is pop perfection. It is clean, loud, dynamic, and truly classic! Itâ??s a powerful pop album in its truest sense. This is a sleeper album that years from now will be passed on from friend to friend and timelessly enjoyed.				</description>

					Though two of its members have much higher-profile pedigrees â Dan âVapidâ Schafer has plays in Screeching Weasel and the Riverdales, as well as leading the Methadones, and Jeff Dean is in the Bomb â their new collaboration, Nosie By Numbers, with bassist Rick Uncapher (Textbook) and drummer Jimmy Lucido could easily be overlooked outside the punk underground, and that would be a shame. Noise By Numbers draws inspiration from the fertile â80s indie-rock scene of Husker Du, the Replacements, Dinosaur Jr. and their ilk as well as classic Chicago punk sounds like Naked Raygun and the Effigies to inject a heaping dose of sing-along melody into every propulsive and hard-hitting groove, making for an instantly familiar yet somehow distinctive and fresh-sounding formula. The band released it's debut record, "Yeah, Whatever...", this year on Asian Man Records.				</description>

					Nothington is a band from San Francisco, CA.  Most describe Nothington as sounding somewhere between Social Distortion and Leatherfeace.  Fans of PBR beer, Irish Whiskey and overall irresponsible behavior will like this music... At least that has been the case thus far.  Their blend of gruff vocals and sing along melodies makes their music good to put on for a long drive or just for having a beer on the coach with some friends.  Their first record titled "All In" came out in 2007 and was followed up by 2009's slightly more aggressive release "Roads Bridges and Ruins" on BYO Records.   Nothington will crash your pool, eat your food and barrow your parents car if you let them.   The group has also been banned from at least one venue on the east coast, and are hoping to make that number rise soon.  These are the droids you are looking for.				</description>

					I first met O Pioneers!!! when I was 18 years old, which would have made Eric about 20. They were on one of their first tours, right after â??Black Mambasâ?? came out. My friends and I loved the Pioneers because they sounded like the bands we were into Against Me!, Hot Water Music, The Broadways but also seemed like totally normal, honest punk rock kids, just stoked on life and having a great time, and their songs reflected that fast-paced, relentless guitars cranked as loud as their amps would go and hoarsely shouted vocals stretched to the brink of collapse from too many nights of reckless screaming.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Over the years, they would always make a point to pass through town for a show, and it was always exciting and inspiring to see how they had grown both as a band and as people. Now, three years later, weâ??ve all grown up a bit. The wide-eyed excitement of youth has become clouded by the pitiless rigors of the real world, long workdays have taken their toll on weary backs, and fizzled relationships have left a slightly jaded lilt to our words, yet we still carry onward with the same fires burning beneath us.				</description>

&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In early 2011 we plan on releasing our new full length record, Conveyor, and hitting the road again as hard as ever.  Hope to see you out there. 				</description>

    <description>
					Emerging out of the quiet, peaceful state of Maine in 2002, OUTBREAK has proven to be anything but the generalizations made about the state in which they originally began. As simply put by ALTERNATIVE PRESS, OUBREAK plays "fast, furious, and absolutely unrelenting."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
OUTBREAK has developed a global following through international touring, landing on five of seven continents to date. The band has given themselves few limitations, supporting old-school hardcore bands like AGNOSTIC FRONT, modern punk bands like A WILHELM SCREAM, and even recent appearances at mainstream festivals with the likes of RISE AGAINST and TAKING BACK SUNDAY. But it certainly hasn't been an easy ride; vans have been crashed, financial disasters have come full swing, and members have come and gone through it all. In 2010, it's a surprise in itself that OUTBREAK still exists. Or is it? Original member and vocalist Ryan O'Connor comments: "My stubbornness probably has a lot to do with why we're still a band - people have called me crazy for not throwing in the towel throughout the many bumps along the ride, but I just look at how far OUTBREAK has come from the beginning and think it would be crazy to give up! I don't like starting things and not finishing them, so while I still have things to say, the band is going to continue on. I know how trendy the punk/hardcore scene can be, so I'm thankful that there's still people on board with us, but having the band as my outlet goes well beyond "hype factor" and record sales."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
While the band's new self titled album is only their second full length effort to date, among OUTBREAK's discography is several other splits, EPs, and singles, notably a split with ONLY CRIME (boasting members of DESCENDENTS, BLACK FLAG, and GOOD RIDDANCE) and two releases via hardcore/punk mainstay Bridge 9 Records. For the new album, OUTBREAK has followed suit with several high profile acts, and has opted to self-release their new album through Connor's ever-growing Think Fast! Records - and thus far, business is good. The new album has been called "tighter, smarter, and livelier" by ALTERNATIVE PRESS, "thought-provoking and exciting" by OUTBURN, and "the best album of their career" by PUNKNEWS.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					For a relatively young band (in tenure, average member age, and spirit), P.S. Eliot have a lot of experience under their belt. Allison, Katherine, Katie, and Will, together as P.S. Eliot, are one&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
of those bands who learn from doing and go all out in that regard. With only a demo released, they set out on an East Coast tour, followed by an LP and a two-month full continental United States tour. Never hitting the brakes, P.S. Eliot did a quick spring break tour with partners-in-crime, Richmond's The Two Funerals, and completed another two-weeker with Houston's Football, Etc. Drawing from '90s indie rockers like Tsunami and contemporaries like Lemuria, the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Birmingham, Alabama natives touch on the personal and the asinine while maintaining a feminist consciousness. With their most recent Freedom School Records 7" and another LP on the way, P.S. Eliot have nearly perfected their brand of My So-Called Life-inspired pop punk.				</description>

    <description>
					Former BYO Records standouts Pezz went on hiatus in 2001 to start families, be peace activists, go to school and travel the world. The band kept in touch and played every once in a while, but became a truly active band again in the fall of 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In 2008, Pezz released a split LP with friends While I Breathe I Hope, and also released a video for the song "I Liked Your Rough Draft Better," from the band's fourth album. On June 11th of this year, Pezz released a new "The Wicked Leading the Blind," to mark the 20th anniversary of the band's first show. The new EP, released by Fat Sandwich Records, features two originals and a cover of "Watching You Sleep" by friends and former BYO label mates Leatherface.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After years of nonstop touring with the likes of Hot Water Music, At the Drive-In, Leatherface, 7 Seconds, Samiam, the Bouncing Souls and the late Wesley Willis, Pezz now stays close to its hometown of Memphis for the most part. However, the band did manage to go on a short tour with the Meat Puppets and Dexateens last year and play Fest 8.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Pezz became a three-guitar band in 2010 with founding members Marvin Stockwell and Ceylon Mooney both on guitar and vocals, Christian Walker on bass and vocals, Shawn Apple on guitar and Graham Burks on drums.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Plans are in the works to release the five other songs recorded at the summer 2009 session that produced the new EP, and to continue to write and record new songs and play shows.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Pianos Become The Teeth has a melodic yet uncompromising sound that brings to mind such diverse and influential bands as Thursday, Envy and City of Caterpillar. Brimming with sincerity and brandishing an experimental ambiance, the band is pushing beyond the boundaries of a stale genre. Mixing elements of screamo, hardcore as well as post rock, Old Pride breathes new life into a once decaying scene.				</description>

    <description>
					On April 15, 2009, PJ Bond began his year long experiment, the year of a thousand roommates, before which he gave up his home and most of his possessions, and took to the road.  365 days of singing songs, sleeping on floors and not having a place to go back to or things to slow him down.  And yet, somehow, here we are approaching the end of 2010, and you can still find Bond singing in living rooms, basements, bars and on street corners all around the world.  You may hear Bondâs music as Americana, Folk/Punk, Alt-Country, whatever, but ultimately they are just songs about friends, family, good times and bad.  Whatever style of music moves you, you will find something to connect with in PJ Bondâs music, which will only intensify upon further listening.  Despite having spent the majority of the last 8 years touring in bands, super DIY and otherwise, Bond remains committed to staying positive and excited about music, as well as building and maintaining relationships around the world.  Who knows what the next project will be, but regardless, you can be sure it will involve good tunes and good friends, and probably a whole lot of late night good times.  				</description>

    <description>
					Protagonist, lying hidden behind the plastic aesthetic and the mass of consumers in Boca Raton, Florida, play their own brand of melodic punk anthems. Led by desperate vocals, racing guitars and an unrelenting drum assault, they stick out like a festering sore in a city known more for its riches and beaches than music. Protagonist takes punk rock and plays it at face value. For them it is an outlet to shout, sing and cry-out against everything that is wrong in the world. Before the onslaught of social networking sites that have facilitated the laziest and most undeserving bands to get a tour booked with the click of a mouse, Protagonist were jumpstarting their hometown scene with their hardworking DIY ethic. Always active, they released demos and booked and promoted their own shows at VFW halls and skateparks all over Florida. They're steadfast attachment to the DIY ethos helped Protagonist build a fan base in Florida and abroad after beginning to actively tour in 2001. All this work would not go unnoticed. Legendary New York Hardcore label Blackout! Records (H20, Kill Your Idols, Sheer Terror) took notice and released the band's first full-length record entitled "Hope and Rage" in 2003. Well received by critics, the band toured relentlessly on the album garnering more attention than ever. Protagonists next step would be to write, record and release their next effort the "Reasoning with Time"Ã?Â EP. The short 5 song record (featuring 3 originals and two covers) is over before you know it, but not before showcasing their growth both musically and lyrically. In 2008 they kept the nonstop touring assault in full-effect, even venturing as far as Japan to showcase their melodic hardcore punk to an extremely receptive Asian audience. Recently, Protagonist finished their highly anticipated second full-length. Titled, "The Chronicle" Ã?Âthey recorded the album in their hometown before sending it to Jamie Woolford (The Stereo, Punchline, The AKA's) to mix it at Room Sound. Upon hearing the record Vinnie decided in a heartbeat that he wanted to put it out on Paper + Plastick.  In June of 2010, Protagonist went back into the studio to record a new EP with producer Stephen Egerton (ALL, Descendents) and a Fall release date is expected.				</description>

    <description>
					"Pure Graft" The band was formed by guitarist Ben Ralston and bassist Simon Hubbard, who met on their high school cross-country team, under the name "Half Past Dead". The decision to form a band came outside of a Five Knuckle concert when both were refused entry. Danny Lesta was added for vocals and David Hillier, the school janitor, was welcomed into the band, allegedly because he was old enough to purchase alcohol for Ralston and Hubbard, both of whom were under the legal drinking age. The band used Ralstons friend, Chris Mcmanus, as their drummer cos there was no one else in Newcastle who could play double time.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Now "Pure Graft" like to play the occasional gig and get very drunk (apart from Ben).				</description>

    <description>
					Red Collar plays rock and roll. Of course that can mean a lot of things but at its core that's what Red Collar's music is, period. It's the effrontery of early 90's Dischord bands. It's straightforward, working- class lyrics with the earnest delivery of Springsteen. It's the shout-along choruses of The Replacements and the buoyant, danceable rhythms of The Clash. Taken together, it's a bold, energetic wall of sound that dares the audience to come a little closer and join in the fun.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"There's a feeling in the room when Red Collar is playing that is hard to describe. It is as though the club or room has been lifted from its foundations and pulled straight up--that we've been taken out of time, and transported to a time before ironic posturing became the norm. A time before we used terms like post- anything. I'm not talking about false nostalgia for a better time. Just a different time. When this band plays it is ALRIGHT to yell along and to clap your hands."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					The Sainte Catherines have been around since 1999 and are the first band Fat Wreck Chords has ever worked with from Quebec. Montreal to be exact, sacre bleu! Their Fat debut, Dancing For Decadence (2006) is a perfect representation of their hard-working, hard-drinking, hard-hitting brand of punk rock. People call them crusty, punk, metal, hardcoreâ¦whatever, but they sarcastically describe themselves as âMotley Crue taking a bath with Tragedy while Hot Water Music argues with Leatherface about the state of punk rock.â At least we think itâs sarcasticâ¦? The band is currently working on a new album to be released in fall 2010.				</description>

					Shitstorm is a grindcore band born out of Miami, FL. The band's been kickin' out recordings since 2004, highly influenced by early Napalm Death, Terrorizer, Repulsion, and all things old school and noisy as fuck!! Now a 4 piece, Shitstorm is made up of Rick Smith (Torche, ex-Mehkago NT), Dvid Smith (ex-Mehkago NT), Jonathan NuÃ±ez (Torche), and Eric Hernandez (Capsule, ex-Kylesa). 				</description>

    <description>
					Shook Ones were founded at the end of 2004 in Seattle, Washington. While one could make obvious comparisons to hardcore favorites Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, the band also manages to blend the subtle influences of Descendents, Jawbreaker and Nirvana into their raging catchy hardcore tunes. Self described as "nonsense meets melody," the band has been nothing if not prolific in their career. 				</description>

    <description>
					Smoke or Fire was formed in 1998 while the brainy punks were still attending college in Massachusetts. The long-time pals teamed up originally under the name Jericho and played basements throughout the Northeast. It wasnât long after graduation that they tired of Bostonâs high cost of living and migrated south to Richmond, Virginia. It was here, tucked beneath the Mason-Dixon line, that the band could not only live affordably and work on their songs, but also be a part of a vibrant musical community that boasts a storied punk rock past and presently teeming with talent. After playing shows and perfecting their songs the band was plucked outta RVA by Fat Wreck Chords just in time to release their debut, 2005âs Above The City.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After the relentless tour schedule in support of their last full-length This Sinking Ship, Smoke or Fire decided to let the dust settle and slip under the radar for a bit. Much to the jubilation of their fans, the guys didnât do much resting during the down time. In fact, they were busy writing new material and making plans for their return to the spotlight. With a bevy of new songs in their cache and spots booked at Harvest of Hope and SXSW (not to mention, a whole bunch of stops in between), Smoke or Fire figured they would wet our collective appetite with the two brand new tracks on the Prehistoric Knife Fight 7â.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
With one listen to the new material it is overtly apparent that the guys havenât lost a step. Prehistoric Knife Fight definitely stokes the flames of interest for Smoke or Fireâs upcoming full-length while simultaneously satiating the long-growing desire for new material. Fans will find that this was well worth the wait.  				</description>

					truly a band that contains all of the elements: bass, drums, guitar, and vocals.  throw in the fact that these dudes (and gal) are a "glass half empty" kind of band, and you'll see that they produce a sound that only cynicism can explain.  can you count to twelve? can you tickle the pickle? can you ski the slopes? can you taste the paste? would you cut the cabbage? should you?  there's only so much you can see.				</description>

    <description>
					Formed in the fall of 2006, Soul Control has garnered quite the reputation for themselves. Statements about "being happy not releasing a full-length and touring for the remainder of their career" were made, so when the band announced their signing to Bridge Nine Records, it was quite a shock. In the past, Soul Control had released EP's on Rivalry Records and a series of singles on various indies, toured across the U.S., Europe and Central America and were successful doing so. Bridge Nine came knocking in winter of 2008 and the guys decided it could be time for a change. Guitarist Jim Connolly said, "Initially, we didn't have the intentions of recording a full-length album. Bridge Nine came around and we knew they'd push it as hard as we would, so we switched the plan up." With a sound that started out as more straight forward mid-90's influenced hardcore, the quartet (comprised of Rory Van Grol on vocals, Eric Anagnostis on bass, Ryan Pitz on drums, and Jim Connolly on guitar) has emerged with a noisier, looser influence from bands like early Helmet, Jesus Lizard, and Unsane, but still mixed with a contemporary hardcore groove.   Connolly stated, "We didn't just want to write hardcore songs with this part here and that part there- we wanted to write great songs and we had a change and a chance to re-explore that." And explore they did, as evident on their Bridge Nine Debut Cycles. Recorded in May 2009 with Jay Maas at Getaway Recording (Bane, Verse), Cycles is a diverse album with tinges of both straight-ahead hardcore and the sound of old school AmRep bands. Soul Control wears their influences on their collective sleeve and while Cycles is completely cutting edge, it still possesses the familiarity of their hardcore roots while showing the world just how loose and jazzy hardcore can really get. Connolly went on to say, "Every release of ours has sounded different from the one before it and Cycles is no different. We had been pretty mid tempo for a while and this record has some faster stuff, a little heavier, a little noisier." Boasting a grandiose tour history, Soul Control is THE definition of D.I.Y. touring. Connolly said, "We don't wait around for offers, we just go. This is how we do it, we tour hard."				</description>

					â??When I first heard of the band, it was from a friend of mine, who told me about a transplant band from New Mexico. He said they were raw, East Bay-styled pop-punk. Of course, it piqued my interest, being the lover I am of the Crimpshrine-era of Lookout Records. The first show I caught was noisy and fueled by bottomless drinks, but the next time I saw them, I heard the chords, the words, and how they came together to form their own take on â??the Gainesville sound.â? As we got to know each other, I found them to be hard-working guys writing catchy songs, guys willing to push themselves musically and personally; propelling themselves into parts unknown. Once strangers and now friends, these guys have made a record that I love. Inspired by North Carolina sounds, East Bay guitars, and old home New Mexico mixed with new home Gainesville, Iâ??m proud, honored, and somehow always buying them breakfast.â? â??

    <description>
					Static Radio are fest veterans (this being their 5th time playing) and I'm not sure if this says more about Tony W's questionable music taste than the bands talent! Static Radio NJ hail from a tractor warehouse in Flemington NJ, and being from such a weird place it could be said that they have nothing to do other than play mediocre punk songs, drawing inspiration from the better bands that they tour with like The FArteries and Fallen from the sky, conjuring up a sound somewhere between G.W.A.R and groovie ghoulies. Even though this band is less well known than Andrew Creams name, thier aquired sound has gained some high praise; Brian Falon of Springsteen backing vocals fame was once quoted as saying "i supoose you're ok for a cut and paste punk band!" High praise indeed my friends, high praise indeed - but dont let all this name dropping put you off cause the drummer chris is very good at kung fu! After last years fest static radio tried to change their sound to become more appealing to people, in a way that was more obvious than The Fartliners. did it work? I suppose you will have to come and find out yourself. "So, what should I expect from seeing Stacic radio at The Fest?" I hear you ask! Expect to be under-whelmed...				</description>

					Formed in 1999 in Richmond, VA, Strike Anywhere has defied categorization and broken down walls of what it is to be punk. Strike Anywhere is more than a band; Strike Anywhere is a movement, a sound and a force. The bandâs incredibly solid career has spanned ten years across the globe, releasing four critically acclaimed albums while remaining a staple in the underground music scene since their inception. Comprised of Thomas Barnett, Eric Kane, Matt Smith, Mark Miller, and Garth Petrie, Strike Anywhere is undoubtedly one of the most influential melodic hardcore bands of our time. With release of their Bridge Nine Records debut, Iron Front, the momentum in Strike Anywhereâs career is just as strong as ever. 				</description>

    <description>
					  You probably know this much already: Teenage Bottlerocket (or simply âTBRâ to their fans) is currently one of the hottest bands in punk rock and their new record, They Came From The Shadows, is highly-anticipated.  But before we go any further you should probably know that they're from Wyoming.  Crazy, huh?  Although more famous for its frontier forts and characters like Butch Cassidy, the âFront Rangeâ (as it's known to the locals) may very well be the unlikely home to the next great punk rock band.  At least that's what the kids are sayin'.  But don't take our word for it, even Alternative Press featured them as a âBand You Need To Know in 2009â... and they don't even have those Jennifer Aniston haircuts!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
  Their beginnings are as humble as they come.  Three friends (two of them being identical twin brothers) wanted to start a fresh, no-bullshit punk band that defiedâif not openly mockedâthe corny emo groups that were pervading malls, mainstream, and MySpace.  They took the spirit of Midwest bands like Alkaline Trio and Dillinger Four and added the earnest sensibilities of the Ramones.  It made for such an undeniably likable combination that other bands were asking themselves, âWhy didn't we think of that?â Not long after their forming, they doubled their number of vocalists and were joined by Kody, a fellow Wyoman and frontman of the beloved Lillingtons.  With a solidified four-piece lineup they did a bunch of touring and two studio full lengths with Chicago label, Red Scare Industries.  At this point things were happening fast for the young punks from the Cowboy State, and after playing shows with bands like the Queers, NOFX, The Falcon, and Dead To Me, they were snatched up by Fat Wreck Chords.  And that's where Teenage Bottlerocket is today.  Oh, if you must know the truth, the band takes it's name from an old spray-painted jalopy that used to cruise the streets of their hometown.  Much of the time spent in those early days revolved around goofing off and carefree skateboarding, and that fun spirit is still reflected in their music today. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
    Few things are more exciting than a young band with a great new record on a new label.  Their booming, seemingly-sudden popularity is reminiscent of bands like Against Me! and Gaslight Anthem, so who knows what to expect next from these upstarts.  If their unhinged live show is any indication, it won't be for lack of trying.  So stay tuned and expect nothing but continued success from these punk rock bandits.  They're certain to make Wyoming proud. 				</description>

					Head due south out of Downtown LA till you run out of freeway. Then make a left, go a ways down, and make another. Keep going till you see Mr. Peck's big old blue house on your left. The old man who drove the first Southern Pacific train engine into San Pedro had it moved here about 95 years ago from a ritzier location. Let yourself in the side gate and go around back. You hear that twang, that crash, that rumble? Right here, where the debris meets the sea, That's Incredible.				</description>

    <description>
					From Chicago, a band since 1996, the Arrivals are the Jam meets Dillinger Four in sound and spirit, something like Naked Raygun trying to revisit the Kinks.  They play a kind of working class punk rock that's not patriotic, not overtly populist, but thoughtful and authentic.  The songs are artfully written and delivered with urgency and forthrightness, with well-informed lyrics that center on the lives of lower class Americans and general disillusionment with civilization. The Arrivals is real modern music from the urban Midwest. It's is rustbelt realism at its best.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In the last part of the decade leading up to the 2010s, the Arrivals evolved into their own species of punk rock animal, in the way that the Clash did as the 70s became the 80s or Jawbreaker did during the early 90s.  And their latest album "Volatile Molotov" (their fourth full-length) tops all.   With classic rock and punk references strewn throughout, they've called it their "love letter to their favorite music."ÃÂ  Todd Congelliere of Recess Records says it "listens like a classic novel."ÃÂ In any case, it's not to be missed.				</description>

    <description>
					The Arteries are a bunch of guys from Swansea, Wales, who have been playing punk rock forever.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
While other kids grew up and got hip or pop they just dropped out and carried on shredding like descendents of the Descendents. And itÃ¢â¬â¢s that spirit that sets them apart, well that and their unrelenting work ethic.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Their new album displays a myriad of rock influences, from Hot Snakes to Lagwagon by the way of AC/DC, but there's no bullshit. No matter where they play - gardens, skate jams, garages, high-rise flats or hotel rooms - they rock out and that's why they've made it to the upper echelons of UK punk rock supporting the likes of The Bronx, Chuck Ragan, Fucked Up, Dillinger 4 and Propaghandi in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
So for their new record, Dead Sea, (follow up to last year's debut Blood, Sweat &amp; Beers, on Household Name Records) The Arteries are channeling their fiercely independent attitude and self-releasing the album on their own collective DIY record label, SWFU, with a little help from Specialist Subject. What's more Paper + Plastick, the record label founded by Less Than Jake drummer Vinnie Fiorello, will be picking up Dead Sea in January and putting it out on vinyl to give the artwork, all created by bassist Jamie Morrison, the platform it deserves.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They're not trying to change the world; they're just a bunch of friends who play music together and like to party. But they do it so well you'll be hooked forever too.				</description>

    <description>
					Who the hell are the Biters? To start with, they are a four-piece band based in Atlanta, GA, with the exception of one member who lives in Baltimore. The members of the band are; Tuk, formally of the Heart Attacks, on guitar and lead vox, Matt (guitar, background vox), Travis (bass, background vox) and Joey (drums. He ainÃ¢â¬â¢t Phil Collins). Matt, the newest member, is the one who lives in Baltimore for those paying attention. The band came together with the addition of Matt in November of 2009 and hit the ground running. The band began rehearsals as the Biters, with their first show that month. From there, they started making quick noise in the Atlanta music scene. Rising to become one of the top bands in the city. Their record label, Underrated Records, also based in Atlanta, has a series of EPs planned for the band in 2010.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Songs like the debut EPÃ¢â¬â¢s lead single and brilliantly fun Ã¢â¬ÅHang AroundÃ¢â¬Â to Ã¢â¬ÅSo Cheap, So DeadlyÃ¢â¬Â show the beginnings of the bands breadth all the while still sounding like the same band. Just like the Biters influences: Cheap Trick, Sweet, T-Rex, and Big Star all five of the songs on the EP contain lots of harmonies and strong chorusÃ¢â¬â¢ and a concerted effort to sound as good as possible. Something the band feels is lacking in so much of modern day underground rock. The music does not need to be polished spit-shine clean, but it should always sound as good as possible otherwise whatÃ¢â¬â¢s the point. The lyrics, while seemingly innocent, actually may imply something more sinister; a really good time either going on or already had. The listeners get to choose and find out for themselves.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In addition to the Biters, Tuk is a part of a gang called the Hate City Rockers. This benevolent crew puts together great shows in Atlanta and is working on a follow up to the successful Ã¢â¬ÅNow Dig ThisÃ¢â¬Â video series. The idea is to bring back the rock shows (think Old Grey Whistle Test and Top Of The Pops), from the 60Ã¢â¬â¢s and 70Ã¢â¬â¢s. The first installment of Ã¢â¬ÅNow Dig ThisÃ¢â¬Â, which featured a select group of 5 Atlanta bands shot in in the winter of 2010, has spread like wildfire by word of mouth. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In between recording, the band has hit the road, bringing their fantastic live show to the masses and building a solid, faithful, supportive and strong fan base. This is another area in which the Biters work very hard; play great shows. The band wants to be able to deliver each song live just as they do on record, but with even more energy and heart. The kind of energy only a live show can allow. This idea, while not new but somewhat forgotten, has worked very well for the four guys. Fans love it, as do many of those who have never seen them and are not familiar with the Biters. After one show or listen, the Biters are hard to forget.				</description>

    <description>
					â??NAKED RAYGUN was a huge inspiration for me. Along with Fugazi and Leatherface, they helped create the bedrock that defines the â??Gainesville soundâ?. As much as I discredit the root idea that such a sound even exists or is quantifiable to such a finite point, I will at least concede that there are certain key influences for many a young (at heart) local miscreant.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
I digress. The fact that twenty-one years after NR played a legion hall in Gainesville, we are putting out a record that not only stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the best NR album, but perhaps surpasses, well, this blows me away. I have a hard time finding words that express how much Pezzatiâ??s voice shakes me to the core. So Iâ??ll abandon words entirely and quote the man himself â??Whoa Hey Hoâ?. Yes. This record means that much.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Crafting the music and bringing the workhorse/powerhouse ethic are Jeff Dean, Mike Soucy, and Pete Mittler, who have truly risen to the occasion. They have been in countless Chicago bands, and continue to split their time with several noteworthy, exceptional bands, including The Methadones and Four Star Alarm. Energy. Focus. Intensity.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
As if it could get any better, the album was recorded by J. Robbins, who also makes appearances on various songs. He really brought out the best in the band and songs, amplifying and directing, especially in the vocal harmonies and melodies. Pezzati turned in vocals on the last Paint It Black album, and Dan Yemin returns the favor here. Bob Nanna also lends his inimitable pipes to the mix.â? â?? Var, No Idea Records				</description>

					The Catalyst are all there is, all there ever was, and all there will ever be. The Catalyst controls the fate of every atom and molecule in the universe, and several billion outside of it. The Catalyst witnessed the big bang, and found themselves somewhat... underwhelmed. The Catalyst came up with all the ideas for the Naked Gun movies, but then forgot them until way later. The Catalyst can take bong hits at thrice the speed of light. Did you see that? No, of course you didn't. The Catalyst eat planets and shit supernovas. The Catalyst collects kinetic energy and swords. The Catalyst fashioned a lightning rod and erected it near a puddle of amino acids three and a half billion years ago, and thus are responsible for all life on earth. For this, we are deeply sorry. 				</description>

					The Flatliners are back for Fest IX, making this year their 4th time taking part of the weekend-to-end-all-weekends. In the preceding 3 years, they believe their pasty Canadian skin hasn't been abused enough by that devilish Floridian sun. They've been training in their native habitat of Toronto, determined they can drink more this year and play better (worse) than the years before. You're likely to hear them play some songs from their new album 'Cavalcade' (released in April on Fat Wreck Chords) and from their single 7" entitled 'Moumental' which is due out September 28th, also on Fat Wreck. There you have it: Canadian. Music. Beer. Fest 9. Come check out the shenanigans.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					     There's two sides to every story, and Gainesville has more than its fair share to answer for in terms of impact on the music world. The past two decades have seen a score of dubiously-legendary bands crawl from our miserable, swampy cesspool and claw their way into the annuls of debatable history. Whether respected or spurned, at this point its safe to say that most music fansÃÂ maintain a preconceived notion of what bands from Gainesville sound like.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
     Luckily enough for the local denizens, who are usually treated to a Friday night of rehashed transplant grave-pissing, there are and have always been bands who are considerate enough to forgoe our town's overbearing legacy and craft music on their own terms. The Future Now are onesuch band. Rather than culling their influences locally, their geographic references reach cross-country to the Northwestern sounds of the early 90s and then onwards to the fertile Athens, GA scene that spawned later that same decade. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
     With a sound that finds itself anchored by that familiar overdriven Fender guitar tone, The Future Now honor the tradition of compelling guitar rock with steadfast precision while rising above those who have come before by perfecting the three-part harmony (of particular note - as a three-piece band). As an upstart ensemble, its difficult to predict how they will eventually fall into the vast spectrum of the musical rainbow, but with a powerful debut release like Hazy Orange Sunday and the energy and enthusiam of a still-green label, one can certainly expect a promising and prolific future. 				</description>

    <description>
					The Great Explainer and fellow New Jerseyens Chunksaah Records have teamed up to release the band's debut EP, The Way Things Swell. With Bouncing Souls' Pete Steinkopf turning the knobs and production duties, The Great Explainer have crafted five compelling cuts of dual vocal post-hardcore. I'd say somewhere between the driving and lung crushing punk of early Hot Water Music and the nimble riffing of Nines and Six/Record Play era Mock Orange, The Way Things Swell stands and stands as an unstoppable force.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
It's a similar trajectory to Polar Bear Club's 2005 demo, but with a more realized and focused dynamic. Take the opener "Quotas" and closer "Michael Jordan 666", rather than a forced anthem, the group sing alongs are a natural progression to the respective song. With "Codeine... Bourbon", the gruff/clean juxtaposition of co-guitarists Sean and Matt's* vocals offer a melodic competence and urgency that is destined to give their contemporaries a run for their money. And that's of crucial importance: With the rising popularity of emotional, '90s throwbacks, The Great Explainer contribute a stellar debut with a level of freshness that, these days, is few and far between.				</description>

    <description>
					The Magnificent are a band from the North of England. They sing about stuff that affects their lives. Important things like pigeon fancying, coal mining, big balls, brewing beer, cutting down trees, playing squash, bureaucracy, coalition governments that don't work and whippets.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The Mags' live show is a drunken, sloppy, fun thing*. At least the band have fun if no-one else does. Their sound has been compared to Pinhead Gunpowder, The Replacements, Billy Bragg, The Pogues, The Clash, Alkaline Trio and maybe someone being sick. If you are American, the music sounds English. If you are English, you have never heard of this band. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Officially, the summer of '10 has been spent recording some new stuff and writing for a new record to be released at the end of year. Off the record, the boys have been losing their jobs, getting engaged, riding old motorbikes, wrestling, going to Portugal, playing golf and not rehearsing.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The Mags started in 2007 and the current line-up is Matt (guitar, vocals), Jimmy (bass, vocals) and Charlie (drums). Their first LP 'Pay The Crimes' came out on Boss Tuneage in 2009.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The band are proud to fly the flag for Blighty at Fest 9. Bring it on!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					After releasing an especially lauded EP and touring much of 2009, Philadelphia's The Menzingers have been dubbed a "Band You Need To Know" in 2010 by Alternative Press and they have a brand new full length proving why. Chamberlain Waits may very well be the most important record released so far by Red Scare and on it The Menzingers combine many of the genre's styles (punk, hardcore, folk) to make for an undeniably infectious hybrid of hits. Produced by Matt Allison at Atlas Studios (Alkaline Trio, Less Than Jake, Lawrence Arms), this band and this new album are destined for great, great things.				</description>

    <description>
					Head south past the Mason-Dixon line and into the swamp-hot humidity of North Carolina's summer months, and a porch-swing singalong with The Moaners starts to sound very appealing.  Melissa Swingle (formerly of alt-country darlings Trailer Bride) and Laura King (formerly of Grand National) have been conjuring the spirit of the South over five years and two records, with the ambitious goal of "[capturing] the feeling of ... Faulkner's South, O'Connor's South."  With Nocturnal, their spell is stronger than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Nocturnal is The Moaners' most mature statement yet, tempering their ferocious, stomping garage rock with a songwriting sensibility that is by turn mysteriously dark and whimsically joyful.  Each track offers something new from the band:  Humid Air and Raggedy Tune explore new rhythmic approaches and textures, while Cowboy Bob boasts their most adventurous arrangement to date. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Earl Poole Ball, the long-time member of Johnny Cash's band who famously graced the piano bench on The Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo, flew in from Austin to Durham, NC to track piano for these sessions.  His distinctive playing further illuminates The MoanersÃÂ¢Ã¢âÂ¬Ã¢âÂ¢ significant contribution to the cultural landscape of the American South.				</description>

    <description>
					Evolution is a natural process that can neither be forced nor contrived, but can be accellerated by constant pressure and motion. Since their inception a few short years ago, The Riot Before have kept their burners on high, maintaining a perpetual drive that propelled them almost overnight from obscurity to legendary road warrior status. From their humble, guileless beginnings, theyâ??ve rapidly matured into an experienced and irrefutable force. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
PAPER + PLASTICK SAYS:&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
â??Straight up, 2008â??s Fists Buried in Pockets was my favorite pop-punk record of the year. The lyrics, the melodies, the way the record ebbs and flows â?? it remains in my car as a CD that defines the album experience. In a way, working with The Riot Before has come full circle since Tony at Southern Lovinâ?? slipped me their CD and made me aware of what I was missing. That experience was honestly one of the best examples of when friends introduce you to bands that you get hooked on. For Rebellion, the band decided to record with J. Robbins, and the way the record captures the bandsâ?? live intensity is spot on. Brettâ??s lyrics are by far in my top twenty as far as songwriters go; theyâ??re descriptive and have an amazing depth to them.â?				</description>

					The Situation started playing last year in Portland, Oregon. So far they've played shows with All, Samiam, Nothington, and the Menzingers. The songs are simple and loud. The people in the band are simple and loud. They want nothing more than the glory and riches to which all rock bands are entitled. And they will burn every book, eat every dolphin and stab every old lady it takes to get them. 				</description>

    <description>
					After several unsuccessful attempts at mining alpacas for wool and chickening out of bank robberies a young Jesse Swan Thorson thought he could make himself rich at playing music. He had no idea how wrong he was. Boasting drunkenly at a divebar in Fargo, ND he convinced some local half-wits to form a band and Pretty Boy Thorson was born. Stringing together music ripped off from Merle Haggard songs and misunderstood bible quotes, Pretty Boy Thorson managed to write and record several records. They embarked on many tours which were merely a thinly veiled excuse to search for Curly's gold after misunderstanding a late 80's Billy Crystal movie. Building what few people would call a 'huge following' by trading tapes advertised in Soldier of Fortune magazine the band skyrocketed to mediocrity. Quickly tiring of Mr. Thorson's deranged antics members of the band fled to opposite coasts of the United States. Realizing he was too lazy to continue on his own, Jesse along with life partner David Strait recruited punk legend Jonny C from the critically acclaimed Rest of Us (Tampa, FL) and a guy named Mike from some bullshit band called The Ergs, they changed their name to The Slow Death to stop running from the obvious. They are now considering touring with top bands and maybe getting a haircut.				</description>

					The Snips are a Rock'n'Roll influenced punk band hailing from Welland, Ontario. These Canadians have been playing together for over a decade crafting a sound with an honest and endearing quality that will kick your ass and leave you wanting more. TheyÂ¹ve taken their live show across the continent, with a high-energy, booze swilling, pelvis thrusting stage performance. TheyÂ¹ve earned the acclaim of the D.I.Y. scene and recently caught the attention of Paper + Plastick with their new Blackouts E.P. The Snips are a band that isnot to be missed as they take their travelling sideshow across the globe in their mission to drink this world under-the-table...all in the name or rock'n'roll.				</description>

    <description>
					The Soviettes started playing in oct. 2000.  We recorded some records and hit the road. Along the way we met the most amazing people and bands...our pro bros, and had the time of our lives. Our last tour was epic hitting all 50 states.  When we came home to mpls, a break just happened and all of the sudden 5 yrs had passed.  Red Sound wanted to release Rarities and we decided let's play again.  So here we are. The Soviettes are Annie, Danny, Susy, and Sturgeon, but FEST 9 will see Mikey Erg (and another surprise bro) filling in for Danny, only because he's dedicated to the Pavik Museum of Broadcasting in Mpls.  Special thanks to everyone who still cares to hear our songs. Xoxo				</description>

    <description>
					The Tim Version are an English rock band, one of the earliest space rock groups.  Their lyrics favour urban and science fiction themes.  They are also a noted precursor to punk rock and now are considered a link between the hippie and punk cultures.  Formed in November 1969 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Dave Brock, The Tim Version have gone through many incarnations and styles of music.  Critic Jim Green describes their trademark sound as characterised by "that gargantuan and impenetrable pre-metal/hardcore drone, those great riffs, that inexorable drive to destinations unknown".  Dozens of musicians have worked with the group; fantasy and science fiction writer Michael Moorcock was an occasional collaborator.				</description>

					we are five friends having a great time playing music together... we've released an e.p., a full-length, and a split! you can find our music at asian man records, quote unquote records, and sidejar records. we all feel the best when we are traveling together and getting to see old friends, making new ones, jumping off of high things into water, and playing music every night. right now everybody lives all over the country.... we're from atlanta, lexington, denver, brooklyn, and massachusetts... we write songs that are political and personal. this is what pine magazine had to say about us: "the celebratory storytelling and punk-folksy delivery of this four-piece makes you wonder how such clean guitars could get your body shaking so hard. The Wild are a lot of fun, and their approach, defiant in a Bob Dylan sort of way, should give kids everywhere the feeling that they can make a difference in the world, no matter how bad things get in the interim..."				</description>

    <description>
					Common ground is important for a band. Tin Armor has learned this lesson well. Since they're humble beginnings in the winter of '06, they have played hundreds of shows across the country, produced two releases: a full length, A Better Place Than I Have Been, available on One Percent Press and a self-titled 7" vinyl single available on Whoa Oh Records. They recently completed another full length, which is awaiting release. Over these years, Tin Armor has learned to write, record and perform in spite of and in light of the differences that each member brings to the process. They have crafted a unique sound which blends melodic, pop-sensible songwriting with literary and often introverted lyrics. Their honest style of rock and roll is approachable without being boring, thought provoking without being pedantic. As they work to expand and improve their sound, they continue to learn this valuable lesson: common ground is not found, it is made.				</description>

					       Going through life fat and stupid is, actually, a brilliant way to handle the almost unbearable weight of existence. Let the Daves' music guide you to a better place, where no one actually knows much of anything except that partyings tight and self-destruction can be a creative act. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
	Dumb comes in many moods and flavors. Too Many Daves is good-dumb. We have made the following reference chart which doesn't mention any music, just movies you may have seen.  &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
       TMD is "I'm-going-to-stay-this-color" dumb like in Steve Martin in The Jerk, not Father of the Bride Part II stupid-fucking-bourgeois-problems-dumb. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
       TMD is good-drunk-nihilism-zen-dumb, like Chevy Chase in Caddy Shack, not what-the-fuck?-child-friendly-assholeishness Chevy Chase The Karate Dog dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
       TMD is Super Troopers cops-on-weed dumb, not Starship Troopers aliens-and-Scientology dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      TMD is Meatballs hide-your-boner dumb, not Meatballs 4 Corey-Feldman-is-a-boner dumb. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      TMD is fat dudes encouraging sweaty people to kiss each other. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      TMD tells time by their slices. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      TMD burns weed, not pizza. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      TMD is much better than they should be. &lt;br /&gt;&#13;
      They all have Dave somewhere in their names and there are five of them.				</description>

    <description>
					Miami has earned its fair share of notoriety over the last 30 years, but most of it has been nothing to brag about: The Liberty City Riots, the Mariel Boatlift, and the Cocaine Wars of the early 1980s recast the formerly sleepy beach town/retirement colony as a lawless urban hellscape crowded with pimps, powder queens and cutthroats, where liquor-store shootouts, revenge bombings and police corruption threatened to drown the tourist trade in an ocean of blood, booze, and yayo. But now the peace-loving citizens of Miami finally have something they can hoist high as an enduring emblem of cultural and civic pride (besides KC &amp; the Sunshine Band, Gloria Estefan and 2 Live Crew, obviously)&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Enter Torche, the four-pronged Floridian Riff Colossus that has steamrolled its way across the international underground. Led by vocalist/guitarist Steve Brooks (formerly of doom dropouts Floor) and featuring the myriad talents of drummer Rick Smith, bassist Jonathan Nunez and guitarist Juan Montoya, Torche unfurled their self-titled debut in 2005 via Richmond, Virginia's Robotic Empire. The glorious half-hour of blissed-out power-grooves, triumphant vocal harmonies and cosmic resonance within was variously hailed as "stoner pop", "thunder rock",ÃÂ and "doom pop",but a consensus was quickly reached within the Fourth Estate: Both the underground and mainstream press had their hands halfway down their pants just thinking about listening to Torche. The band was immediately lauded as giants among men, leaders among sheep, and powerbrokers of a deadly new sonic idiom founded upon Brooks' signature "bomb-string" detonation-detune. As Decibel magazine so righteously pointed out in May of 2005, Torche "carries on in the dizzying Sabbathian tradition of Floor, only potentially more bottomless and epic." Seven months later, the same publication would declare Torche as the # 7 album of the year in its annual top 40.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
 "Never let it be said that bong-rock types hate hooks," Spin magazine announced. "Torche set their guitars on 'dirge', work their vocal harmonies, and say amen to Foo Fighters' riff-o-matic preaching."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
"At long last, we know what life would be like in a parallel universe where the Melvins became a pop sensation instead of Nirvana," Revolver magazine added.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
With the verdicts in, Torche swiftly set out to slay, punish &amp; conquer. Stateside tours with Scottish post-rock marvels Mogwai and hypno-metal heroes Isis ensued, as did a European invasion with Savannah sludge captains Baroness. "Torche"'s debut jaunt to the UK will undoubtedly leave a monumental impression on the audiences they have played for as they mix the pop-tinged catchiness of tracks such as "In Return" and "Erase" with the likes of "Iron Girl" and boil it down to a cocktail of raw and powerful sludge-filled beauty," Terrorizer magazine gushed after witnessing the band's show at the Manchester Attic. Rock Sound issued similar proclamations after the London Underworld show: "Louder than a really loud thing, Torche hit the stage with all the grace and subtlety of a misfired nuclear warhead. Sounding far fiercer than on record, the Florida outfit's "bomb-string" assault is truly a thing to behold."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
So: Citizens of Miami, rejoice. Music fans, exult. Torche are about to rule your stereo and your face all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Hailing from Los Angeles, Touche Amore set themselves against the glamour and greed of their hometown culture with ââ¦To the Beat of a Dead Horseâ, the passionate debut LP.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
In the last year, Touche Amore have become of vibrant part of the flourishing West Coast hardcore punk scene, successfully bridging gaps between subgenres. By playing their explosive and sincere music in every basement, VFW hall, club and space up and down the West coast, along side hardcore torchbearers Converge, Bane, and Trash Talk as well as like-minded, discordant bands Ampere, Comadre and La Quiete, they have brought a feeling of togetherness and positivity to a scene they love. Unafraid to play their emotionally charged fury in front of uninitiated crowds.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
ââ¦To the Beat of a Dead Horseâ marks a real turning point in the life of the band. Where TAâs demo 7â, on No Sleep Records, was full of promise, ââ¦To the Beat of a Dead Horse,â never feels fully realized: the guitars bend and weave but always maintain their drive, the rhythms are frequently off kilter but never off-time and the vocals are screamed at the edge of breaking up but theyâre always exciting, pleasing even. This record was completed not compromised.				</description>

    <description>
					Trigger Effect began in 2003 and have since been a relentless presence in punk touring playing 400 DIY booked shows since 2005 all over Europe and North America. Their non-stop, chaos filled 20 minute sets have gained them a reputation as a furious live band which has allowed them to share the stage with many of the bands which inspired them such as Coliseum, Lords, Ste Catherines, Trap Them, Priestess, Grimskunk, The Casualties, Danko Jones, Cancer Bats, Bison BC, Wednesday Night Heros, The Real Mackenzies and most recently The Bronx.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They have released 2 full length albums and a split 7 inch which have gained distribution and garnered press the world over all without the aid of a manager, agent, or record deal.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The band has just completed a 44 show tour which took them to 12 European countries, 6 states and 6 provinces on the heels of their latest release, Versitis Maximus and are touring the East Coast US fall to the legendary Fest in Gainesville. 				</description>

					Tubers. Organic creations, blooming beneath the soil while drawing nutrients from their surroundings, soon to be unearthed, cooked, and consumed by native populations. Also, Floridian slang for two populations. The first; those who float upon inflatable inner tubes in aimless, lackadaisical delight down the stateâ??s many freshwater springs. The second; those who seek adventure tucked away in the innermost furl of a wave just before it washes ashore. Finally, four long-time friends who make music for the purpose of challenging themselves and hopefully those around them.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They draw inspiration from their namesakes and channel these feelings through guitars, throats, and drums. All four offer considerable musical and lyrical contributions, creating a unified and representative front that defies the traditional â??primary songwriterâ? model. Angular riffs swerve throughout the mix atop surf-influenced rhythms, with the aggressive trappings of previous efforts remaining apparent but not overbearing. They speak in dialects and metaphors, fluctuating seamlessly amongst obtuse structures, shifting momentums, and rolling cascades. 				</description>

					Twelve Hour Turn was a band from Jacksonville, Florida.  Our first show was February 1, 1997.  Our last show was July 19, 2002.  Man, those were the days.  For the first time we were meeting all these people making it happen for the love of it-writing music, putting out records, touring, writing things down, painting things...  We got to be a part of that.  We got to play music onto record and to people throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe.  Now, these are the days!  We aren't a band anymore but we will be again soon for just a little while.  We might even write a new song or two.  "Don't let the music die, and don't replace me."				</description>

					Vacation Bible School has been a band for thirteen years. How is it we've been around so long, and you still haven't heard of us? Well, we never said they were a "successful" thirteen years. But now, years down the road, people finally seem to be beginning to give a fuck, and we couldn't be happier. Chicago based Mid-Western pop punk that says, "Hey, I could've done better with my life, but it's not like anyone gives a fuck, anyway...". 				</description>

					VICIOUS CYCLE is part of the new wave of Canadian hardcore, using vintage-punk and 80's hardcore as their template, they're a band that challenges themselves by breaking free of the usual hardcore trappings. Experimenting with numerous musical styles VICIOUS CYCLE attempt to blend influences and bend the traditional current music scene.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Paper+Plastick owner Vinnie Fiorello says, "VICIOUS CYCLE takes nods from many bands but never duplicate any sound or structure. Break-neck punk meets modern hardcore with lyrics that drive the catchy hook home to your brain..."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The band has toured North America and Europe with bands ALEXISONFIRE, BURNING LOVE, and STATUES. From basement shows with the VIVIAN GIRLS to sold-out shows with ALEXISONFIRE. The diversity of the band shows by the diversity of the line-ups they share, from indie rock to hardcore from CANADA to the US to EUROPE the bands numerous influences and elements allow them to share stages with bands that live and breathe outside of their genre.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The bands last record PALE BLUE DOT was a blend of traditional American hardcore and experimental instrumentation. VICIOUS CYCLE bring an unrelenting, innovative and unique sound in the vein of FUCKED UP, FUGAZI, REFUSED, and forward thinking hardcore. PASTEPUNK says, "Pale Blue Dot does nothing to disturb the momentum that starts on the opening note. The band plays to its influences in near perfection" while JERSEY BEAT says, "Blistering and slightly melodic hardcore punk (in the original sense) is on VICIOUS CYCLE's menu" and "The production quality is raw, dirty, and smacks of analog."&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
VICIOUS CYCLE is excited to team up with Paper+Plastick to release their single "Numbers B/W Over the Edge".&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
With new songs the band plans to punish the envelope the way you would come to expect from a band that has as many roots as VICIOUS CYCLE.				</description>

					Vilipend are a Toronto, ON, Canada-based ânoise/hardcore/metal/whateverâ band that have toured with Lords and Barn Burner and shared stages with the likes of Today is the Day, Psyopus, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Cursed, Converge, High on Fire and countless others. Formed in the fall of 2007, Vilipend have been working incessantly (Black Flag-style), writing, recording, rehearsing and delivering their brand of artistic musical violence to anyone, anywhere ever since. Featuring a live show thatâs chaotic, engaging and, at times, uncomfortably real and unnerving (with blood spilled and bodies and gear broken). Life-long companions of DIY and adversity, Vilipend have constantly plowed through divisive scene politics, irrelevant musical trends and even vocalist Christopher Gramlich fracturing a vertebrae in June of 2009 during the final song of their now infamous set with the Dillinger Escape Plan at Torontoâs Mod Club. Fully healed and back to destroying stages as of September, 2009. Vilipend are currently writing for their debut full-length (tentatively titled To Impede The Healing Processâ¦), which will hopefully be released before the death of 2010, while continuing their relentless live blitzkrieg on the Great White North, with expansion into the States next on the agenda.				</description>

					This is the attempt at the â??adultâ?? (I use the term extremely loosely) punk band. Not like porno punk or anything (well, not too much), just kinda grown up.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Sam Johnson, guitar god, singing sensation, lives in a barn house with a bunch of animals (i.e. 1 bulldog, 3 cats, 3 horses, 1 pretty girl). Oh yeah, he has spent years on the road learning the whatâ??s what of being an international touring machine with his band NEW MEXICAN DISASTER SQUAD. Sam is also a professional slacker. Thats right, screen printer. Thatâ??s where all those radical D.I.Y. VIRGINS shirts come from, so whether you like it or not, he man-handled all of â??em. This aging punk wants to get back in the van, despite the fact he probably should have grown out of it a long time ago. Now instead of having a degree or any type formal certification whatsoever (other than the rules of the road), Sam now tirelessly slaves away crafting punk anthems and working in a hot, shitty warehouse for you. Bryon Lippincot is now currently enabling Sam to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Eric Pitman, drumming dynamo, baby-faced sex-crazed wild man, also at your service. One of Samâ??s coworkers at the screen print shop of horrors and not to mention old buddies, is a studious intellectual on one side but when night falls, Mr. Hyde rears his ornery head. It was kind of understood that Eric would end up as the drummer for VIRGINS. Shit, if he doesnâ??t take out his aggression on those skins, he just might murder somebody. And heâ??ll like it. And he might do it again. Pitman is a punk institution in Orlando and if you donâ??t know him by now, you probably donâ??t matter. This boy wonder is a volatile icon to perversion, perfected. A man devoted to food, drums, awesome-ness, and partying. And food. He should be the President.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Speaking of institutions, Phil Longo is fucking nuts!!! This bass-booming, smooth talking, Italian stallion might just be your new best friend. Master of disguise, bartender extraordinaire, Longo has already earned his place in Florida underground history (we used to call it â??undergroundâ?? music) playing in countless hardcore, post-hardcore, and post-post-hardcore bands. As Sam was mooching some free drinks one night at a prestigious local rock club, Phil asked Sambo if he wanted to do a RITES OF SPRING tribute band. Sam said no, and then drunkenly forced Phil to listen to the first VIRGINS demos. All said, Phil has what it takes when he walks on stage in front of two-dozen people to look his best, play his best, and be his best.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Three brothers in rock â??nâ?? roll, broke as shit, desperate as hell, punk as fuck. Perhaps just like you?				</description>

    <description>
					Wavelets is a band that started in 1991. The few who had heard of the band labeled them as pioneers of the emo genre later popularized by bands like Cap'n Jazz. After original vocalist David Draiman left the band to focus on his other project, Wavelets went on hiatus in 1996. Fast forward to 2009; Wavelets decides to reunite sans David Draiman. Unfortunately, their status and significance has been lost in the annals of time, and in a cruel twist of irony, critics are accusing them of being influenced by the very bands they influenced, such as Street Smart Cyclist, Grown Ups, and Snowing.				</description>

    <description>
					Unhappy with the current state of ska music, We Are The Union decided to stick out their own necks and tried to change things for the better in the summer of 2005. Getting a paycheck is not on their agenda. Instead of following typical ska punk conventions, WATU takes a harder-nosed approach to the genre. With influences ranging from Philadelphia/New Jersey favorites Lifetime and Kid Dynamite, and bands like Slapstick and This Is A Standoff, they rage with the best of them while still retaining a heightened sense of melody. Their love for fast music, horns and their incredibly short attention spans are a simple explanation for why WATU sound the way they do. Over the past two and a half years, they have also been incredibly hardworking. With nearly a dozen tours in the US and UK under their belt in this short span of time, theyâve now thrown caution to the wind and continue to be on the road full time. This will surely add to the list of heavy hitters theyâve shared the stage with that includes The Suicide Machines, Shook Ones, Mustard Plug, Set Your Goals, The Flatliners, Voodoo Glow Skulls, Make Do And Mend, Spring Heeled Jack, Bomb! The Music Industry, The Aquabats, Four Year Strong, Such Gold, Fireworks, Hostage Calm, Transit, The Wonder Years, The Swellers, A Loss For Words, and Hellmouth. Their work ethic cannot just be applied to their tours either. Their first full-length âWho We Are,â self-released in the summer of 2007, was given away for free by the band via the Internet. Their generosity was met with a rapidly surging fan base and an offer to have the record released in Japan via InYaFace Records. Their expectations for the band are simple. They want to keep making music they love while touring relentlessly in order to provide people with a positive environment for fun and the venting of frustration. Paper + Plastick saw the youthful exuberance and the amount of integrity this young bunch of punks had and quickly wanted to become involved. 2010 brings the release of âGreat Leaps Forwardsâ, the Billy Bragg-inspired new full length from We Are The Union. Already outselling their previous releases, WATU hits Canada and the US in support of "Great Leaps Forward" with Strung Out (Fat Wreck Chords) and Rufio this August and September.				</description>

    <description>
					On what was almost the saddest day in the lives of 6 young adults,&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Worlds Scariest Police Chases was born. After being kicked out of the&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
police academy for drug abuse, lewd and indecent behavior, and&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
disgracing the campus chapel, these 6 young men decided they were&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
destined to form a renegade police force / musical hybrid project.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
After a couple jenkem balloons Dan Rock, Andy T, Corey, Chris, Dan&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Nelson, and Maxx Gregg recorded a 3 song thunderstorm and decided to&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
use it to bring a sense of morality and honor back to the world.  Of&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
course that didn't work because they don't know what honor or morality&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
mean, but they did arrest a bunch of kids, steal their pot, and get&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
fucked up.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
That's the story for the most part, minus a few torrid tales that&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
would make Motley CrÃ¼e sound like the Partridge Family.  Check them&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
out next time they are in your town.  You'll know where the show is&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
because the churchies will be there protesting.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Put your hands up!				</description>

					We're 100% punk! We're 100% grindcore. We play fast as fuck, have a threatening sound, and the set is always pretty short. If you show up late you'll miss everything. We like when the band and the crowd of people watching come together to form complete chaos. All the members of our band have been in other bands like Assuck, Assholeparade, Gomek, Chronic Youth, Religious As Fuck, Floor, and a million other bands. Who fucking cares? We're talking about WORLDS right now. We've got an 11 song EP out now and a split EP with American Cheeseburger coming out soon. We write songs that are sometimes personal and sometimes political but always fast. We play grindcore but we're not scared of a good hook. There's not much else I can say about us. We like to get weird. Come watch us play because we all have super busy lives that are all over the place and we don't get to play that often these days. Our first show was during the Fest in 2008 so celebrate our anniversary with us. See you in the pit!&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

    <description>
					Worn In Red hail from the long-standing promised land of thick, blistering hardcore; Virginia. They share hometowns in both Richmond and Charlottesville, drinking deep from a rich history of since-fallen bands like Sleepytime Trio, Hoover, Four Hundred Years, Maximillian Colby, Action Patrol, and Frodus, while also paying tribute to contemporary titans Planes Mistaken For Stars, Glass and Ashes, and Hot Water Music.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The â??90s were rife with talented, passionate, and engaging bands who built upon the legacies of their forebearers while pushing the envelope as far as they could, crafting a myriad of fresh and provoking sounds. One of the epicenters was Virginia, former home of the Confederacy and lately a crucible of pluralism. A land where urban uproots rural and tradition trades blows with progress, forging a cultural battleground strewn with ideological rubble. It was here that the gentlemen of Worn In Red came of age, bearing witness to a generation of bands who now live on only in record store lore, all of whom left a lasting impression on the few who were there when it happened. Worn In Red draw on the elements these bands held most dear; a fiercely independent ethic that celebrates the power and capability we all hold, a desperation and darkness brought on by the constant personal struggle with society, and an unflinchingly honest approach to musical and artistic expression. With ideals intact, they unleash their aggression in a hail of gutted screams, churning rhythms, and triumphantly soaring melodies. 				</description>

					Worthwhile Way is Mayu, Kaori, Chege and Akihiro.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
They live in Tokushima, Tokyo and formed in Japan around 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
But that start was three piece girls punk.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Chege and Akihiro were joined on 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;

					"A Wow Owls reunion is like a Terminator movie, the third one sucked&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
but the fourth shows promise of life in the not so distant future" â&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Jeremy Myers.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Wow, Owls! were a five-piece punk rock band from Richmond, VA . In&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
between drinking beer, playing kicker and air drumming to Rage Against&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
the Machine and Nirvana, Wow Owls enjoyed playing music for people&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
before calling it a day in 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The band previously performed its one and only Floridia show during&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
the Fest 4 in rare form. Guitarist Johnny Hall was held up in foreign&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
lands so Jeff put his head down and powered through to learn Johnâs&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
guitar parts to play in what would be the Owlsâ first and only&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
performance as a four-piece. The band has performed three times since&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
technically breaking up so the boys thought it would be a good idea to&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
correct the musical misrepresentation half a decade ago.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Since the band broke up, John, Brandon and Tyler started Mouthbreather&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
(also playing the Fest!), Jeff began playing guitar for Future Cougars&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
(VA) and Best Practices (RI) while Brian still sings his cat, Bagels,&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
to sleep every night.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
The world is a vampire.				</description>

					From the brink of looming collapse, Young Livers return triumphant. Out of public eye, theyâ??ve spent the past two years toiling and tinkering, channeling their frustrations and rage into the eleven songs found within. With the addition of Mike Carter, theyâ??ve found themselves unified on all fronts, an intuitive mental bond as only they can explain. Their songwriting has subsequently taken on another dimension, as Mikeâ??s scathing wail and stringent bass lines meld seamlessly with the commanding rhythms and compelling guitars found on their early releases. Most noticeable, one will find that as Mikeâ??s vocals have overtaken the tortured lows and highs, Matt has found his voice in a more melodic mid-range, the rocky shores against which Mike and Daveâ??s gutted screams crash and echo.&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
&lt;br /&gt;&#13;
Since their inception, one of their most striking aspects has been their meticulous attention to detail. While at times weâ??ve found our hands clamped around their throats, the finished product has always shined through at the last moment to save the Livers from a premature demise at the hand of label tyrants. From their custom, complementing Acorn amplifiers to dozens of late nights spent arguing over song order and art colors, they stand as a testament to patience and steadfast determination within an artistic medium plagued by haste and frivolity. As a result, the culminating effort radiates an underlying majesty and grace that belies their more overt aggression.				</description>
